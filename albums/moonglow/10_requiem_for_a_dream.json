        "[Michael Kiske]\nWhat do you see?\nIs it your own reflection that's staring at you?\nAn out-of-body perception?\nOr some kind of stranger that laughs at a fool?",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nIs it the world that has changed?\nOr is it you at the sound of the knell?\nAnd how did they fail to prepare you\nFor all that awaits once you're out of your shell?",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel the cold breeze in your face\nWalk on, one way\nEnd of days",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nTime to face what it's all about\nMay the waves take you in",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nA long way from home\nYou're out on your own\nTo crave all alone and alone you'll realize\nWhat life turns out to be",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nFuture ain't what it used to be\nWhen all givens they fall into abeyance\nFall into abeyance\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nLet it all wash over me\nRequiem for a dream",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHow long have we stayed in concealment\nChilled to the marrow, crept stealthily?",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nCelestial lights satiating the dark of deplorable reality",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nEvery breath towards what shone with a lustre\nHorizons that sentineled dreams\nNow doesn't it even seem crazy\nTo be aghast at what things will not be",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nSee the rainbow slowly fade\nWalk on, one way\nEnd of days",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTime to face what it's all about\nMay the waves take you in",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA long way from home\nYou're out on your own\nTo crave all alone and alone you'll realize\nWhat life turns out to be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFuture ain't what it used to be\nWhen all givens they fall into abeyance\nFall into abeyance\n\n[Michael Kiske]\nLet it all wash over me\nRequiem for a dream",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nThere's someone by your side\nFour steps behind\nMakes sure you keep the pace\nAnd love the grind"
