        "[Elderane]\nWe're the little creatures\nDeep inside your mind\n\n[Regrin]\nSome call us their fantasy\nBut some do never find",
        "[Elderane]\nWe an teach you philosophy\nBut still we must commend\n\n[Regrin]\nThe state of our existence\nRight in your hand",
        "[Regrin]\nWelcome to this place in here\nCome overstep all your fears\n\n[Gabriel Laymann]\nWhere have you all been once\nWhen I was alone?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWhen I was a hero in their crazy wicked show\nYou've sent no little spark\nInto my darkened view of life",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDid not make me ask for what is wrong\nAnd what is right",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd still I regret to be here\nI'm dreaming of Anna in tears",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nInside - so deep inside\nYou will die if I don't dream anymore?"
