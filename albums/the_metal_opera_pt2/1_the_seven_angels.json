        "[Believers]\nFire falling from the sky\nRage of god is coming down\nAmarggedon's drawing nigh\nSinner cry! Heathen die!\nHear the toll of pain, gloria, gloria\nIn the fiery rain",
        "[Believers]\nNow the time has come, the end's begun\nAnd the only one will come",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nIt has been foretold\nBy the visions of the old\nAnd the madness in their eyes\nSaid his angel will arise",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nThat's what they know: \"Holy Lord it's over, oh god\"",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWe have done no wrong\nSo we go where we belong\nTo the neverending dream\nBut for those who lived in sin",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nThey claim to know: \"Holy Lord it's over, oh god\"",
        "[Pope Clemens VIII]\nHey Angel, can you tell me\nWill you lead us to the place\nFull of heat, in the fire\nFor we only brought disgrace",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nHe is not the one. If they only knew",
        "[Johann Adam von Bicken]\nHey Angel, will you take us\nTo the judgment of his rage\nHey will we die\nFor we couldn't close the gate",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nTo the knowledge as they have been told",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI don't know how could I prove\nNothing but the cloven hoof\nReigning over them as well\nWhile they keep on fighting hell",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBabylon the scarlet whore has come",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWe are the seven, judgement of heaven\nWhy don't we know: We are the angels\nIt's revelation, soul castigation\nFire will burn us away",
        "[Pope Clemens VIII]\nRedeemer, devastation\nHope it only has been ment\nFor the sin of the dreamer\nWho broke the law you'd sent",
        "[Jakob]\nHey, don't know but I wondered:\nWhen we lost the seal again\nMaybe stoned by the incense\nDo we rise or just descent",
        "[Voice in the Tower]\nWoe to you longing for the wisdom\nWoe to you longing for the light",
        "[Voice in the Tower]\nAll my sons bring me back what is mine\nOr you'll end burning in this night",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOnce I have been lost in what they told me to believe\nUntil I felt in burning deep inside to set my spirit free",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd I escaped to another world to help the little men\nWho make me plunge into philosophy - to feel my mind again",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo one left to hold me tight\nOn the real other side\nBut her in chains",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI had been alone till the madman came along\nWith the knowledge and silver long beard\nHe was the first man ever teaching how I could be free",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nHelping me to find - oh - the mind and the soul\nThey've been trying to hide it away",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd he promised we'd help Anna if I'd help him to go all the way",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nGo all the way into the world of minds\nOpen the gate and do not close behind",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nPrevent them from hiding the light away\nPrevent them from tellin'us tales\nOr the end of all they scare us with will be a million empty brains",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI could bring you what you told me\nThe seal they need to close the gate forever",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBut still I haven't found a meaning\nAnna will we ever be together",
        "[Regrin]\nYou've been fighting for your soul\nAnd sometimes it takes a toll\nHope one day you'll understand\nWhat it means to hold in hands\nWhat they call a fantasy\nIt is nothing but a key\nTo the world that now you're in\nThat they call a wicked dream",
        "[Elderane]\nWhen you're walking on your own\nWhen you're broken and alone\nYou may feel us from inside\nOn the other side of life",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI've been fighting for my soul\nAnd sometimes it takes a toll\nHope one day we'll understand\nWhat it means to hold in hands\nWhat we call a fantasy\nIt is nothing but a key\nTo the world that now I'm in\nThat we call a wicked dream",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh, walking on my own\nWhen I'm broken and alone\nI may feel you from inside\nFrom the other side of life"
