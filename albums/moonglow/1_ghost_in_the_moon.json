        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGhost in the moonlight\nThrow your veil upon these grounds\nCold, the night is star-bright\nPale is all beauty of your gown",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDark, frame a fire\nMystery of a blood red rose\nDark, shine sapphire\nYou won't leave me on my own",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRaise my head above the haze\nI woke up to a world\nI feel almost humanized",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTender loving all around\nApparently profound\nThrough self-deceitful eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNow what am I supposed to be?\nFor sure it can't be me\nIn orderly array",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nMy it's feeling so unreal\nHow daunting to be free\nIn the light of day",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLost in this world\nWith no place to go",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAwaiting the night to yell\nA prayer up to the starlight\nVeiling boon\nGhost in the moon",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGrant me admission tonight\nInto your tenebrous wicked star-bright\nGolden gloom\nGhost in the moon",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhispers sounding from the brake\nSinister eyes along the way\nA phantom rushing through the night",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nMake it haste, run from the dawn\nBack accross the Rubicon\nTo the shelter from the light",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBefore the sun is gonna rise\nTo reflect in their eyes\nA sight no one's gonna stand",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, your blood is gonna freeze\nDifferent blood, different breed\nNo one's gonna comprehend",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThey teach you love, they make you belong\nSuck you in to spit you out, the rage is on",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLike a rushing thunder you're a shade in the swampland\nAnd a Trojan horse they'd rowel into your dreams",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThey chase you into dawn to a silken bed of quicksand\nRush, sou you can breathe, they'll give you up\nYou're in my world past remedy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAsking, wondering, look at me\nWaiting, prompting\nI may be drawn to something\nThat I can't phrase for your\nEven though it's true",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI won't be what they long to see in me\nNo matter how desperately they reach out for me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA sedating hand\nThey don't understand, I don't comprehend\nI can't take no more of their shallow light, burning me inside\nThen I am better off a scorn in the night",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm a misfit on a journey and I'm afraid my destiny\nHas been sealed right from the outset",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTo immure the real me\nI'll wane in this world\nJust me and the glow of the moon",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFor the chill of the night is gonna summon a fire\nA strange world on the brink, or a maniacal dream?",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDead matter alive - heart, soul and desire\nRise from the smoke and the fire\nFrom maniacal dreams\nCrucible-born and unseen\nMegalo-maniacal dream",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTo chase the\nGhost in the moonglow\nThrow your gown upon the light\nGhost in the moonglow\nWhisper from the starlit skies",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDark, frame a fire\nMystery of a blood red rose\nMoon, spark a fire\nYou won't leave me on my own"
