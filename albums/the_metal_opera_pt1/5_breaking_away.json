        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nDon't wait my friend. We better don't think twice\nTime to fell the prison guard you gotta realize",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nNo turning back again. Therefor it's all too late\nNew horizons wait...",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nI know the time has come\nTo leave the past behind\nAnd now the time has come\nTo stop them controlling your mind",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBreaking away!\nAll we can do now is break away\nOtherwise she will be dying\nWhile both of us are lying here in chains",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBreaking away!\nAll we can do now is break away\nOh - otherwise she will be dying\nWhile both of us are caught in chains",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAlways been a novice in quest for paradise\nHope they will forgive me for I apostatize",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI can't be no hypocrite, can't wear a masquerade\nNew horizons wait...",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy & Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd now the time has come to go another way\nTo learn for life and to grow ripe\nAnd prevent the decay",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBreaking away\nIt is so hard to lay down what I've been\nBut I must go even if my way leads to Hades"
