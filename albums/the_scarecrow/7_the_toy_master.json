        "Don't you be afraid\nCome and step inside and take a look around",
        "I'm your holy grail in your candy store\nTo save you from the profound",
        "They use to dream in only black and white\nCan't you hear them scream drowning in the tide",
        "Out in the cold I see water frozen in ther eyes\nWhat a sorry sight",
        "I am willing to believe they would pay for a smile",
        "I'm the master of toys\nAnd all you girls and boys\nAre welcome to my wonderland\nI'm the angel of joy\nAnd I'm here to paint the void\nWelcome to my world\nTo my dream factory",
        "Say hello to the gentle man with the paint\nThe deeper you're in the blue\nThe sweeter the sound of your plaint",
        "If only I had a heart it would break - oh sure\nAnd I'd wonder how much more they can take",
        "Out in the cold I see water frozen in their eyes\nWhat a sorry sight",
        "I am willing to believe they would pay for a smile",
        "I'm dealing in pain and a little Novocaine\nWelcome to my world, to my toy factory",
        "No more struggle of the classes\nNo more struggle of the masses\nOn their knees - conformity",
        "They are ready for a hero\nThey are flying at zero\nIt's their turn to crash and burn",
        "I come to bring you pain\nAnd a little Novocaine\nWelcome to my world"
