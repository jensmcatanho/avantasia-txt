        "[Amanda Somerville]\nA dream of a dwelling inside\nAlone we come and alone we go",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nAnd who am I to know what I feel\nSympathy that's tearing me apart?",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nAttraction of the distance to a heart or affinity?",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nWhat if love will leave your heart and open sore\nAnd I can't reveal what even I don't know",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nThe love you feel you waste away on me\nWhat kind of love would let us bleed away\nNo kind of love would make us bleed away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf only you could be\nThe one to take a look inside",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI feel so incomplete\nA broken man in need of mother love",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm suffering in silence\nAnd no one wants to see\nAnd only god is watching as I bleed",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA star above - my mathing piece",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nOh this love will leave your heart an open sore\nAnd I can't reveal what even I don't know",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nThis love you feel you waste away on me\nWhat kind of love would le us bleed way\nNo kind of love would make us bleed away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel - that's all you gotta do\nAnd it will heal you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel the pain to lead you home to peace of mind\nDwell inside",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel - that's all you gotta do\nAnd it will heal the wound",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel - there will be a song for peace of mind\nDwell inside"
