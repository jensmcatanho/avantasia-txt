        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHey redeemer\nNow what has become of me\nTaken in by promise\nAwakening in grief",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nCollecting us like puppets\nYou instrumentalize\nA frigid trepidation\nIn a million puppet eyes",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nGod gave his word just to let us down\nWhere is he now?",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou've been facing heaven\nYou were lost and left alone\nYou're welcome to my home",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nAnd found another heaven\nIt was you who took my hand\nCome into the promised land",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou scratch my back\nAnd I scratch yours\nIt's you who makes decisions\nI just open up the doors",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nWhining in the gutter\nThey forget their sanctity\nWelcome to my clockwork\nVanity machinery",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou gave your word\nYou let me down\nWhat am I now",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh as far as the eye can see\nThey're bent in submission\nEmpty inside",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAn army of scarecrows like me\nThousands of broken dreams\nThousands of tragedies\nTried to run from their destiny",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nLike moths to a flame\nDriven by vanity\nThey've been off to Jerusalem\nChasing a dream, calling on me\nWe're just trading in needs"
