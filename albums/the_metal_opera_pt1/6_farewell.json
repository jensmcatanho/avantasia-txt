        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDays had come, winters had gone\nAnd we gamboled like siblings in Paradise",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI was your knight, holding you tight\nAs a brother when I saw your crying eyes",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nTime went by and we had to say goodbye",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nStaring up to the clouds above\nChildren - so little and sad\nHoping the saints could help one day\nLead us together again",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nHolding the key to the alley of dreams\nStill in hands",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nTime telling me to say farewell\nBut I knew that I would fight hell\nAnd I knew: We will\nGo for another time we can see\nFor another time we'll be free\nFor no more farewell",
        "[Anna Held]\nStepbrother tell me where have you been\nWhen they brought me to this godforsaken place",
        "[Anna Held]\nSign of the cross - they took me away\nFor healing with herbs by the way of grace",
        "[Anna Held]\nNow I wait for the day to feed the flames",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI have been caught in a cage of despair\nMy heart as a monk's cell so empty and bare\nBut no holy water can make me\nForget tou again",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nNo farewell could be the last one\nIf you long to meet again"
