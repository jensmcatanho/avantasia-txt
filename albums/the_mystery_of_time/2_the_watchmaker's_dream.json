        "[Science]\nWelcome to the aftermath of the incidence\nThat made the tower fall",
        "[Science]\nAnother screw for another wheel\nFor another mind won't stray away anymore\nOh won't stray away from its brain",
        "[Science]\nWe must finalise the giant\nTo level off the void and zeroise the will\nThe time will come: you will know what you need",
        "[Science]\nThe time will come: you will know what you need\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\nThe Watchmaker's Dream",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nSimplify simplicity\nYou don't mind what you don't see at all\n\n[Science]\nThe tongue of nations brought in line\nReason occupied: the God-machine",
        "[Science]\nThe tongue of nations brought in line\nReason occupied: the God-machine\nA splendid steaming dream will tower to the sky",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWe'll exploit another 'morrow\nWe drained another day",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe glowing of the future in our eyes\nAnd time will reveal what we need:\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\nThe Watchmaker's Dream",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\n\n[Science]\nWill we slice infinity",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\n\n[Science]\nFor all the world to see",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\n\n[Science]\nWe give you what you need",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe Watchmaker's Dream\n\n[Science]\nThe sound of triviality"
