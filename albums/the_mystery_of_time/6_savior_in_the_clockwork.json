        "[Science]\nI envision how you lie awake and agonise\nOver ways to bear your day just every night",
        "[Science]\nRe-alignment you're in nedd of so imploringly\nIt's the pace that we'll maintain for you",
        "[Science]\nOh, every moment everybody's gonna think alike\nEvery second will be seized\nWhile every in between we'll erase",
        "[Science]\nWe'll erase to take the tangle from their memory\nMaximising one and all for you",
        "[Science]\nNow into line bring them peace of mind\nMind by mind\nSet the pace for all mankind\nLet us take away the spaces\nIn between their given time",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTime to run!\nSavior in the clockwork tell me\nFor how long will I wait on the grind",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTime flies on (Time will fly on)\nSavior in the clockwork take me back inside\nIn between the time",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNow am I half asleep or half unconscious,\nHalf 'adream'?",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI can't move as I am stuck in bright lucidity\nI can feel and hear an see\nBut I won't comprehend",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI see fire that I won't decipher",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI see giant evil tower to a blackened sky\nI feel blessed with evidence of what I can't define",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nSwinging blade of the lowering perpendicular\nI see clarity I won't remember",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nDo I dream\nIs it only fantasy and matter just a thought I see\nAnd time is all they need to steal away eternity?",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNo time to run!\nSavior in the clockwork\nTell me for how long will I wait on the grind",
        "[Reason]\nYou pry into a world too far above\nYour head up in the haze\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nJourney to the birth of the first sun\nInto the black womb of space",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nJourney to the birth of the first sun\nInto the black womb of space\n\n[Reason]\nFather primal space\nWho's drawn the light",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nStanding at the door to epiphanic realisation\nA journey to the centre of forever\nTo the mystery of creation",
        "[Reason]\nDon't you hear the voice: I'm with you\nI'm everywhere and real\nYou can see me, you can hear me without credence\nI'm what your hands can feel",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nGod, I feel I've been away too long\nI feel like I've been dreaming\n\n[Reason]\nIf you'd open up yur door to explanation\nYou would hear the voice of reason screaming",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI've seen the ocean swallow the ancient harmony\n\n[Reason]\nAnd I've seen belief and craving swallow sanity",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI feel my hand is led to ink between the lines\n\n[Reason]\nTall stories legendising: figments of the lie",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAt crack of dawn hazy remains above my mind\n\n[Antiquarian]\nRaise your mind\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nI scribble down those icons that I can't define",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWill they demand account as I'd demand myself\n\n[Antiquarian]\nRaise your mind\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'll never testify what no man comprehends",
        "[Antiquarian]\nAnd they will tear to pieces what they can't define\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nRaise your mind\n\n[Reason]\nIf you don't follow your self-preservation drive",
        "[Antiquarian]\nThey'll crucify the one who won't affiliate\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nRaise your mind\n\n[Reason]\nBut decorate the children of their own ego's way",
        "[Reason]\nTime to run savior in the clockwork\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nTell me for how long will I wait on the grind",
        "[Reason]\nTime flies on (Time will fly on)\nSavior in the clockwork\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nTake me back inside\nIn between the time"
