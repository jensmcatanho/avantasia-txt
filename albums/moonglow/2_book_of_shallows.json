        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhat if I would script a dream?\nAnd if I'd let you in?\nI'd be your door out of a stark truth",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLeave a stark reality\nAn arrant giveness\nI'd make you fall to be there for you",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nLet Morpheus commit his spark\nTo a stray soul wandering\nErrant in the dark",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nChase your dream\nIf you don't mind don't be astounded\nBy the things they make you do\nFor amusement's sake",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nChase your dream\nWhen all comes breaking down around it\n\n[Tobias Sammet & Ronnie Atkins]What a day for a pastel dream\nThat's coming to life",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nBeautiful in colour\nUnited in their creed\nReasonable people dreaming ordinary dreams",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nRise above confusion\nAnd leverage the weak\nDive into the shuffle\nAnd then tap into the freak show",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAnd Morpheus commits his spark\nTo a plain soul wandering, errant in the dark",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nChase your dream\nIf you don't mind don't be astounded\nBy the things they make you do\nFor amusement's sake",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nChase your dream\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nWhen all comes breaking down around it\n\n[Tobias & Jorn]What a day for a pastel dream\nThat's coming to life",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nMay it charm the living\nMay it ease misgiving\n\n[Mille Petrozza]\nIntoxicating, dazing\nRapture of the shallow\nDazed and captured",
        "[Mille Petrozza]\nSay you wanna be now\nSneak into their dream now\nSuck up to their love\nYou're the master of their freakshow",
        "[Mille Petrozza]\nGive into temptation\nSeek and bring salvation\nMine now, Suburbia\nTomorrow it's the nation",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWait for a savior\nRising from the tranquil sea\nThe book of shallows\nBringing forth a common dream",
        "[Mille Petrozza]\nGoing with the grain\nNumb the pain\nWe are common sense\nKnock them down a peg\nMake them beg for deliverance",
        "[Mille Petrozza]\nRapture of the deep, they believe\nTake a deep bow\nGive them what they need now\nMingle with the creep show",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nWait for a savior\nRising from the tranquil sea\nThe book of shallows\nBringing forth a common dream"
