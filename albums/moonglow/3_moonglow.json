        "[Tobias Sammet]\nSuch a beautiful light to undo what I thought I believed in\nWild and cold is the wind that'll blow my conviction away",
        "[Candice Night]\nHear the call of the bright moon above outside of your window\nWould you follow me into a world where reason doesn't pertain",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Candice Night]\nEverything I've come to know is gonna fall to pieces\nEverything you've come to dream is gonna turn out real",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Candice Night]\nA lunar light into your room\nLet it carry you into the night\nMoonglow - let it take you away",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Candice Night]\nThe road aflame - fooling gravity - you follow the light\nMoonglow, Moonglow to the other side",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAll you've told to comprehend\nAnd put in place and understand is gone\n\n[Candice Night]\nIn this enchanting magic light",
        "[Candice Night]\nFollow me into the night to a place by the willow\nLeve all your schemes and your patterns of thinking behind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd I dream how I rise as I look down on the shell on a pillow\nAnd I know I won't try to explain what I've seen in this night",
        "[Candice Night]\nEverything you've come to know is gonna fall to pieces\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nEverything I've come to dream is gonna turn out real",
        "[Candice Night]\nAll you've told to comprehend\nAnd put in place and understand is gone",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Candice Night]\nOh, will you take me over - take me over\nWorld in the moonglow\nMake me feel - this is real\nA face in the moonglow"
