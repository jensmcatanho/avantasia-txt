    "lyrics": [
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nMental vigour's been right on the edge\nTo a 'stupefying' hole of no return",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nNow we dance a holy war is won\nBut there must be more we got to learn",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDon't you know now that I'm here I must go\nInto the morning light - illuminate the night\nBe the guide on our side - the Gnosis",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo return - I will go, follow the call of my spirit\nNo return - I must know all that I never could ask",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo I still can't leave the world in here\nSoon I feel that I am gonna get her free",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBut I've smelled at and I long for more\nTake me in, oh I beg, philosophy",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh I got to know, more now so I must go on\nInto the morning light - illuminate the night\nBe the guide on our side - the Gnosis",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo return\n\n[Elderane]\nMaybe you must pay\nMany've been in quest for truth\nInsanity has swallowed away",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo return\n\n[Elderane]\nBut I wish you all the best\nGo and face the tree of knowledge and be free"
