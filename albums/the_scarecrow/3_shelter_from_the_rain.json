        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLike a wheel I keep on turning\nStraight ahead it's got me burning\nThe melody - the dignity\nSomething is speaking to me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNight is cold and my soul is battered\nNot afraid for the first time now that I realize\nWe coincide, I'll never belong to the tribe",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd a song is calling me to this ship of fools",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nBeen dying for a sign\nWhen faith has been on the line\nWhen you find your love on wasted grounds\nYou're taking to the sound\nIt's shelter from the rain",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nNo return from the way I've chosen\nCast away - chasing rainbows - condemn the lie\nAnd how could I make god believe I am blind",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nWe create by intuition\nCall it fate - the tongue of angels in our soul\nFeel it resound and carry you over the grind",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nAll that's left is a song giving shelter from the rain",
        "[Bob Catley]\nIt's a dark and stormy night\nAin't it funny what it takes to read the signs",
        "[Bob Catley]\nBut I'm always there\nI am the footprints to your right\nMan overlooks when riding high\nYoung and blind",
        "[Bob Catley]\nIn your darkest lonely night\nHeed a voice to take you higher\nTake you higher",
        "[Bob Catley]\nAs you stumble through the ruins\nLet the spirit take you higher\nAnd a song",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI can hear a song"
