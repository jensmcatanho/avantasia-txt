        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA heart out of affection, a night at the masquerade\nYou won some and you're lonesome\nAs the spotlight fades",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGoing forth pretending destination is at hand\nWhen she's crying just a little just for me",
        "[Bob Catley]\nI've seen them set off to the Promised Land\nEscaping from the hurtings\nThey don't understand",
        "[Bob Catley]\nA sense of satisfaction\nOn account of pristine tears\nShe's crying just a little more just like you",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWhy don't you cry, cry a little over me\nWhy don't ou lie\nCan't you tell that I am hard to deny\nCan't she see what I am going through",
        "[Bob Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nCry just a little for me\n\n[Bob Catley]\nOh girl, a little for me",
        "[Bob Catley]\nAfraid to give away what you keep inside\nThere's a ghost in your mirror\nEvery lonesome night",
        "[Bob Catley]\nAnd those nights are getting colder\nAnd your hear is a frozen wound\nDon't you wonder who'll be there when you awake",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWhy don't you cry, cry a little over me\nWhy don't ou lie\nCan't you tell that I am hard to deny\nCan't she see what I am going through",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nCry just a little for me\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nOh girl, a little for me"
