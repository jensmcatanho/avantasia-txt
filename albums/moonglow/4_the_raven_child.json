        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nWild groves, sacred grounds fade to vastness\nMother moon cast your spell on these fields",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nLet the boughs paint ghostly shades on the trail to a different world",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhere the castle looks out to a valley\nWhere I'm given all the love that I crave",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNot afraid of the rising sun laying bare my brittle soul",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nCold is the wind\nBringing forth clarity\nTime rushing on\nAnd nothing will remaing",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nThere's no glory on the last journey home",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLooking down from this pure cope of heaven\nOnto an ocean of white\nThat drowns all the noise and decree\nAnd the craze in empty eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWide-eyed I'm lost in my imagination\nA dream of love I've got to suffocate while I keep on waiting\nFor the hour I'll be called to realize\nAnd see it all before my eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe sky is crawling down the mound\nInto the deadwood on the ground, they say\n\n[Hansi Kürsch]\nSpectres flare and spit and rise to mingle with the skies\nAnd take all that's never meant to be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way\nGonna run and never get away\nIs it love that glows in fiery alignment?",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Hansi Kürsch]\nStarry eyed?\nMaybe living a lie?\n\n[Hansi Kürsch]\nA lonely heart in an endless line",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, raven child, yeah, raven child",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nOh, bewildering and strange:\nThe scent of spring and cherry blossoms\nSweet scent of rain",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThey're calling you\nAstounding how it is not the same it used to be\nWhen you're compelled\nBehind the crenel on your own",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThe tolling of the bell\nIs there anyone to tell me what they wanna say\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nVoices go on and on and on to me\nBut their tongues won't permeate throughout my soul",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nIn your altered state of mind\nIn vain you're chasing light",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYour master and his frown\nDenial of the crown of creation that you're made to think you are",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nA fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way\nGonna run and never get away\nIs it love that glows in fiery alignment?",
        "[Jorn Lande & Hansi Kürsch]\nA fire in the dark for the fool's gonna find his way\nGonna run and never get away\nIs it love that glows in fiery alignment?",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Hansi Kürsch]\nStarry eyed?\nMaybe living a lie?\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nA lonely heart in an endless line",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nLight breeze in the crowns of the willows\nGreen fields - as if the day was on the wane",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nGrow faint and attain to perfection\nWhat a backdrop for a diamond",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd so we sway in the wind like a willow\nMeant to give way to the order of the storm\nWon't leave a mould in the marsh of the ages\nA tired chevalier of fortune",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nBlue and serene once\nA sky swanned on magic\nThe unborn in the stream of destiny",
        "[Hansi Kürsch]\nTime flows to become a mound of nothing\nFor a broken soldier of fortune",
        "Comin' down - goin' all the way now\nYou won't get away you know\nFinally the way you're shown - you're goin' now",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nInto the light\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nIn the light there's a crack torn open from underneath the day\nIn the light, but a crack, is it growing?\nFeel the dark rolling in, your way",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel the light, look way it's gonna blind you\nIgnite you, spirits fly\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nSee a light to uncloak their master\nTo arouse the beaten mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIn the light there's a crack torn open from underneath the day\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nYou dream and fly",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIn the light, but a crack, is it growing?\nFeel the dark rolling in your way\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nHey, raven child",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou tuck away your Self inside\nYou ride away on the inmost light\nYour soul: glowing opal-blue\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nA million voices fade away\nI never really got what they're trying to say\nFor my world there's no getting through",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nOn, you sail to the night's Plutonian shore\nYou drift to sleep\nYou can't take no more of this",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAnd like a raven child you spread your paltry wings\nAnd throw youself into the wind\nTo escape from all below\nThat despised the raven child",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAm I awake or is it an evil dream\nOr maybe the ugly in between\nLike me: a weak hermaphrodite",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nA broken soul in unimpaired parts\nIn quest for light but it was the dark\nThat embraced the raven child",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA cloak of invisibility\nTo curtain the face of deformity\nNo, darkness let me in",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nOff to the night's Plutonian shore\nYou dream and hope you won't wake no more to this\nFlying raven child",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, fiery eyes\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nTo escape from all below\nSpread your wings and go\nLike a raven child"
