        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou turn off the light\nAnd you won't make no difference",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou hear the echoes fade away\nWhen the cries of despair\nTurn to a sound in the distance",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe road ain't divine\nBlack are the wings that will carry me home",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nTower in the night, up to the sky\nCarry our remains angel of light\nTo the dark side of Paradise",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOn wings of fire to the back side of light\nFrom Babylon to Paradise I crawl",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI've seen iniquity galore\nBeen worth a detour and some more\nThe snake in the backyard of heaven",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nVenus guiding to the back door of love\nFrom Babylon to Paradise I'm drawn",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nI've seen iniquity galore\nBeen worth a detour and some more\nThe snake in the backyard of heaven",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI feel how I faint as I'm crossing the Acheron\nWash away my innocence",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWas I losing my way\nWhen the sky has been blackened",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThis short cut of evil\nWhere do they drive me, where will I go",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDays gone by time after time\nI'm going insane, losing my mind\nTo the dark side of Paradise"
