        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFaces in this empty room\nCited in despair\nGazes that I had invoked\nThey're driving me insane now",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWalls have eyes they're staring down on me\nFrom everywhere around",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIn the face of dreams I had\nGrimaces of pain\nNow I am turning helpless\nCallous and alone",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWaiting for a storm to brew\nTo wash my dream and love and sins away",
        "[Andre Matos]\nI'm with you\nI'm the other side\nYou just gotta try",
        "[Andre Matos]\nFly now! No one's gonna care\nCause no one's gonna know\nWhat no one's ever seen",
        "[Andre Matos]\nClose your eyes now\nKingdom on a broken mirror\nClose your eyes now\nBlizzard on a broken mirror",
        "[Andre Matos]\nThe scent of goodbye\nThey're dying away: the sands of time\nSands of time",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFortune favors just the brave\nThat's what the blessed always say",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLove will come in time\nBut I'm always late",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI pray the wine my will to take\nAnd thos evil hands to tie",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWreaking havoc\nBaneful sight is growing dim",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTie the dream I've had my fill\nRaze the love and tie my will\nFire's ploughing up my head\nOh forgive I will forget",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLord are you hiding in the haze?\nThe seventh door I'll try is daze\nAngel send another storm\nTo face another dawn"
