        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe dial by the night\nSeems like what it used to be\nBut now that this town has fallen silent\nI feel memories\nOf good intentions ghosting me",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWatch the tower cloch hand\nCut instants off each hour\nFrom a future that has been devoured",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAlready by their craving for the vague\nAnd even after lucid heartbeats\nFew and far between\nWe're back to gain admission to the wheel",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBending the boundaries\nDeaf to the memories\nWe won't make in the rush anyway",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd God if you're out there\nWhy do you make me spin your wheel?",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nDo you hear me\nDweller in a dream\n\n[Antiquarian]\nYou're lost in the no-zone",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA twilight mover\nPrimal screams\n\n[Antiquarian]\nAre crying for the dweller in a dream",
        "[Antiquarian]\nThe study and a sage\nAn ancient brazen luminaire\nJust a bat flap from answers they wanna hear\nThey're evident\nTo every cynic eminent",
        "[Antiquarian]\nMovement around the sun\nAll in eternal time\nThe heaven's fires turned to light\nThe moon that governs birth and then decay",
        "[Antiquarian]\nThe principle decreed\nBy laws you think you will conceive\nAnd then some accident\nTo throw it all in place",
        "[Antiquarian]\nBending the boundaries\nDon't run from your memories\nI have been there before",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAre you for real now\nOr just a dweller in my dream",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOh, why would your God given road lead to ruin?\nWhy would science challenge facts?\nWhy would your God given will come off the track? Come off the track?\nDweller in a dream?"
