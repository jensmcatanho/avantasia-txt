        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe have roamed the plains a million years\nGathered at the shore\nWhen we had run out of all fears",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nWe have come from everywhere\nCrumbling worlds behind\nReason is what we're gonna give\nTo be given peace of mind",
        "[Russell Allen]\nCrimson is the pavement\nBlood is dripping from our dreams\nTo the sound of smashing yesterdays\nWe dance in ecstasy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, craving devour me, take me away\nOh, to infinity, take me away",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nTake me away\nOh yeah take me away\nFar away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't you turn your face to the night sky\nSaid the fainthearted one\nYou may see through the charades\nAn instant that won't come undone",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI can feel the ease of my pain\nDecline of the blood reason level\nGazing in awe bystanders scream\nMentally critical fettle",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nWe're sailing on gentle waves\nWe read the sky",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nStargazers, stargazers\nBehold the key\nStargazers, stargazers\nInfinity\nReason left behind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhere are you detecting the wrongs\nSpirit that always denies",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI've gone insane\nRelease me from waiting\nFor the sparkle to rise",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nI can see they're nailed to the cross\nCannot live till they're gone",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nImmortal they cry on terrestrial embers\nWhile they laugh at the clown",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nYou feel a chill as if time stood still\nThere's no way out",
        "[Russell Allen]\nStargazers, stargazers\nBehold the key\nStargazers, stargazers\nFor a lucid dream\nYou'll leave the world behind",
        "[Russell Allen]\nOh craving devour me\nRelease me, please, take me away\nTo infinity, oh take me away\nCraving devour me\nTake me, take me away",
        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nStargazers, stargazers\nBehold the key\nStargazers, stargazers\nInfinity\nReason left behind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen the sun rose to wake another day\nThey were gone, gone without a trace",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBabylon, craving in lucidity\nBabylon, the fire will remain",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd the sun razes from their memory\nWhen the dark had cyphered in the sky\nAnd the flame's burning their lucidity\nBabylon, rise up to the night",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nOh, let us wander\nLet us wander between the worlds",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nWe override their principles\nAbrogate horizons",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nAbandon mental gravity\nOh, we overrule the eye",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nCompromise your sanity\nTo heaven\nTo hell"
