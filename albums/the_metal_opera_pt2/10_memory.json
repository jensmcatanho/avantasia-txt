        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nOh, I dare not to sleep anymore\nCause I see her face in every nightmare\nIn all the windows of my haunted house",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nAnd when I dream a dream of flowers\nI wake up in my hand a bloody rose",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\n'Blood shall come upon you'\nSo she spoke to me\nNever knew she'd come back\nNow she's on my dream",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nFrom the faces in my dream\nFrom an evil memory\nAs foretold in their prediction",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nFrom the faces in my dream\nThey are coming back for me\nAs it was told in their predictions",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nIs it just a dream\nOr just a wicked memory?",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nNow I see her coming on her besom\nThe smell of brimstone\nAnd the mark of the beast",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nFrom the open window\nIs it just a dream\nAs she's pulling out the dagger to stab\nA thousand times into my hurting breast",
        "[Bishop Falk von Kronberg]\nWake up from the nightmare\nScreaming when I see her stand\nWith the face of Jakob\nA bloody dagger in her hand",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nMaybe his conscience\nWill send him a dream in his dreams",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nIf I only knew - oh Anna\nIf his soul also came free\nOr maybe if Jakob\nWould talk to the bailiff for you",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI can't come for you\nI don't know how many souls were set free\nTo start a rebellion, don't know if I'll still have to flee"
