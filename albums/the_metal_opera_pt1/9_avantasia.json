        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOpen my eyes\nAnd see my bleeding wounded hands\nFeeling the pain too hard to stand. To stand...",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nCaught in the 'now and here'\nWhile they're on the way\nHiding imagination, leading us astray",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nUse your mind\nYou will eave the flesh dimensions behind\nSanity can be the toll\nLeading to the core of your soul",
        "[Gabriel Laymann (along to the voices in his head)]\nWe are the power inside, we bring you fantasy\nWe are the kingdom of light and dreams\nGnosis and life: Avantasia",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWalking along the icy gallery of pain\nTell me now: What can keep the flame alive?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nLack of imagination - raising up the tower\nWhere they hold our souls\nTo take away the power",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh, Avantasia\nI hear the voices\nInto the light, into the light\nOh, Avantasia"
