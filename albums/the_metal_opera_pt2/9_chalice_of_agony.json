        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nShow me the way to the hallways\nBelow Rome, I will be there\nI've seen them burning in fire\nThey all bear too much to bear",
        "[Elderane]\nWhy don't you think of all those who will come\nDon't you waste your life\n\n[Gabriel Laymann]\nDon't you try show me the way\nDon't need 'good advice'",
        "[Elderane]\nCold hallways so old, a chalice of gold\nA guard as they say, paralyzed\nFollow the cries from out of the blood\nThe wine in the cup",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOut of the wine, out of the chalice of agony\nWelcome to Avantasia!",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nRegrin my friend we are passing the gate\nBack into my world\n\n[Regrin]\nI am afraid of the guard and I wish\nWarnings had been heard",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWelcome to Rome, it's our mission\nTo make tortured spirits rise\n\n[Regrin]\nSomething's in here, oh I wish I could hide\nFrom its staring eyes",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nCold hallways so old, a chalice of gold\nAnd I feel a chill\nStaring eyes, while I hear the cris\nFrom out of the blood, the wine in the cup",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo way out, we got to run to the gate\nNo way out, for some of the souls it's too late\nJakob are you free"
