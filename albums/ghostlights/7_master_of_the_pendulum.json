        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWho's the one who's stretching out his hand\nIs it It or is it me that won't lose hold",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTake on to the pendulum and sway\nLike a mistletoe I'm clinging to the cold",
        "[Watchmaker]\nI am the trellis for those in need\nTo twine around\nThe rock of ages for those\nWho're meant to wander around",
        "[Watchmaker]\nI got no time for a break\nAnd we got no time to waste\nI'll save it up in the pace\nI'll quantify thoughts awat\nThat you don't need anyway",
        "[Watchmaker]\nOh, what a beautiful day\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nTic toc tic toc\nSomeone's watching over me",
        "[Watchmaker]\nBegging for a dance\nWhile your sands are running out\nRigid and firm's what I hold in my hands",
        "[Watchmaker]\nTick away time, I allot and I divide\nMaster of the hands that guide you",
        "[Watchmaker]\nRun if you can while the war drum's tickin on\nAncient of days: I'm the shouldering pace",
        "[Watchmaker]\nI will make you mine, I allot and I divide\nMaster of the hands that push you",
        "[Watchmaker]\nThat's who I am:\nThe master of these hands",
        "[Watchmaker]\nI lead the horse to the water and I make it drink\nI'm here to force precision just on everything",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI feel your breath in my neck\nI feel you behind my back\nAnd as I'm turning around\nThere's just this frightening sound",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI feel it everywhere\nOh, I know that you're there\nTic toc tic toc\nSomeone's watching over me",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBegging for a dance\nWhile your sands are running out\nRigid and firm's what I hold in my hands",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTick away time, I allot and I divide\nMaster of the hands that guide you",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nRun if you can while the war drum's tickin on\nAncient of days: I'm the shouldering pace",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAngels fall\nTime's gonne winnow all\nDying dreams\nRight from wrong\nDwell in a run\nTurn the wheel\nSome thing's reaching out for me"
