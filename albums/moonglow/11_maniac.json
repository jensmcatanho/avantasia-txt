        "[Tobias Sammet]\nJust a steel town girl on a saturday night\nLooking for the fight of her life\n\n[Eric Martin]\nIn the real time world no one sees her at all\nThey all say she's crazy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLocking rhythms to the beat of her heart\nChanging movement into light\n\n[Eric Martin]\nShe has danced into a danger zone\nWhen that dancer becomes the dance",
        "[Eric Martin]\nIt can cut you like a knife if the gift becomes the fire\nOn the wire between will and what will be",
        "[Eric Martin & Tobias Sammet]\nShe's a maniac, maniac on the floor\nAnd she's dancing like she's never danced before",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIce blue line of insanity is a place most never see\n\n[Eric Martin]\nIt's a hard won place of mystery\nTouch it but can't hold it",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou work all your life for that moment in time\n\n[Eric Martin]\nIt could come or pass you by\n\n[Tobias & Eric]\nIt's a push shove world but there's always a chance\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nIf the hunger stays the night",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThere's a cold kinetic heat\nStruggling for the peak\n\n[Eric Martin]\nNever stopping with her head against the wind"
