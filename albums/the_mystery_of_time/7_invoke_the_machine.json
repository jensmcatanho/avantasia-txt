        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nHome to the land of the living\nRoused by a sound I confide\nAnd what am I to cast my tired eyes upon\nWhere was I when the clock had been alive?",
        "[Nobleman]\nI see a marvel right in front of me\nThere's a man, who's got tomorrow in his hands\nDon't you see what you are meant to be\nOutside your cloud-cuckoo-land",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTime won't wait for those who stay behind\nTo wait for time\nIn these tangible realms hesitation's a crime",
        "[Nobleman]\nIn the night: A secret mysterious dream\nDead of night, while the town lies asleep\nWe invoke the machine",
        "[Nobleman]\nThose dreams that you hummed to yourself once\nHow far will you reach out\nTo make them come true",
        "[Nobleman]\nWill you turn around to shirk from duty\nOr force the pace while it's all up to you",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA giant leap is to be made now\nI'm struck with awe\nWe're gonna heed the inner call",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nMy hear beat quickens\nI behold the god-machine\nI can't help but write history",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAs my glance wanders\nTo the far off end in the sky\nHissing and screaming, almost alive",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nIn the night my life came apart at the seams\nDead of night, let's run up the wheel\nWe invoke the machine",
        "[Nobleman]\nIn the night: A secret mysterious dream\nDead of night, the town lies asleep\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nIn the night those in hiding are waiting for me\nDead of night, let's run up the wheel\n\n[Nobleman & Aaron]\nWe invoke the machine"
