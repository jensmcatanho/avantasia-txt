        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nLord above - why don't you tell me\nWhy I'm here in agony?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI've been serving, I've been praying\nNow I'm caught in misery",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI've been praised by friar Jakob\nI misused his confidence\nCheated by this work of evil\nFeigning Anna's innocence",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh what have I done?\nSo many ways lead to the fallen one\nLucifer, fallen light",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh what have I done?\nWhat is going on?",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nWe should bring salvation\nNot give in to his temptation - no!\nRead and preach the holy word\nAnd no forbidden lies that hurt\nI remember words of \"seven\"\nSet me free - sanity!",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nReach out for the light\nFar beyond confines\nYou have read the magic lines\nLeading to the light in your mind...",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWhat is right and what is wrong now?\nIs it a trial of paradise?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nIs Anna a witch or do they stick to an error?\nWhat's the book and the seal inside?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAm I a cleric or maybe a sinner?\nUnbeliever? Renegade?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWas it the devil who led me to \"seven\"?\nOh redeemer is it all too late?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nOh what have I done?\nI have been led by the smelling one\nLucifer, fallen light...",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nTell me stranger, what have I done?\nOh what's going on?"
