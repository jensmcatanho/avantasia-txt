        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFor too long now I've been\nAdrift in this ocean that washed over me\n\n[Ronnie Atkins]\nDeluting the secrets that you had to keep\nFrom the world that's been",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nSpinning around you, with and without you\nSedating, unking\nShow you the way\nDeliver and faint\nRelish to stand in line",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI guesse you'll find no one to blame\nWe're tied to the rules of someone else's game",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nTry to fly, flap your wings\nAs you look to the night sky\nA gilded cage in the twilight",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou dance on a wire\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nSee the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nBeen caught in a mire\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nNow you're reaching for the starts",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nDance on the wire\nTo the breeze that carries change tonight\nYou will see the Great Pan in the starts\nThe piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFor quite a while I have been the one that I thought I was happy to be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nMasquerade, at least a shadow play\nNo one's gonna see...\n\n[Eric Martin]\n... behind the fa√ßade, those rallying calls\nYou're afraid to awake",
        "[Eric Martin]\nLook at the sky, you can't defy\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nThe dark that is calling your name",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou're blind by the beauty around\nYou're numb by the touch and you're deaf to the sound...\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\n... of the sweet-smelling bright melody of the moonlight\nThat devours the bars in the twilight",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou dance on wire\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nSee the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n[Ronnie Atkins]\nBeen caught in a mire\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nNow you're reaching for the starts",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nDance on the wire\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nTo the breeze that carries change tonight\n\n[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou will see the Great Pan in the starts\nThe piper at the gates of dawn you'll hear",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nNow open your eyes, ain't it what you've been wanting\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nToo much to fathom, until it unfolds",
        "[Bob Catley]\nEndure what you're in for, you're meant to be longing\nKing fo the wave, now keep flailing about",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nWe're the dream that inhabits the waking old world\n\n[Eric Martin]\nWe're right here, we're the doorway to guide you across",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nExposed to the spirits that you're meant to be citing\nMisfit and misplaced, you'll never belong",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nWe're the breath you don't catch\nWe're the great expectations\nYou ain't measured up to on the beautiful side",
        "[Eric Martin]\nWe're the promise not kept - bred in desolation\n\n[Bob Catley]\nWe're the will of the wisp - demerged from the light",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGet me out of here\nTake me away\nTake me - Take me\nTake me away - Take me away",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou dance on wire\nSee the piper at the gates of dawn\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nNow you're reaching for the starts",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou'll see the Great Pan in the starts\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nThe piper at the gates of dawn is near"
