        "[Gabriel Laymannn]\nDrawn by the sound of that wild raving pound\nNo one has told me",
        "[Gabriel Laymannn]\nI gotta know all about hell and below\nThey never told me",
        "[Gabriel Laymannn]\nThe quest for nexus\nIn your life and for all that's beyond",
        "[Gabriel Laymannn]\nWhen I gaze at the man who is gazing at me\nWhen I stare into the looking glass\nWhen I ask what he sees",
        "[Gabriel Laymannn]\nThen I'm asking for more and the more that I wanna know\nI know what I'll never know",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nFrom far away, from the state of decay\nYou've come to wisdom\nMany've been led into madness instead",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nToll of my kingdom\nThe quest for nexus has brought\nMany men of genius to insanity",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nThen you're asking for more, and the more that you wanna know\nYou know what you'll never know",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nAs long as you long for the whole\nYou can't get a part of at all",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nHow proud would the buildings of Rome\nLook without all single stones"
