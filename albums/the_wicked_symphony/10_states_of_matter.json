        "[Russell Allen]\nYour mind to infinity\nLet reason rivet on your feet or you may fall\nYou're drawn into a distant glow",
        "[Russell Allen]\nYou dream of voices from on high\nBut can't evade another rainy night\nAnd putting on another show",
        "[Russell Allen]\nHate and affection\nPleasure and pain\nModes of vibration\nUnveiling to be all the same",
        "[Russell Allen]\nAnd when the final day has come\nIt's another state of matter",
        "[Russell Allen]\nAnd when you face another sun\nIt's the union of the states of matter",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFailure and defeat and all the riches surely beat\nWhere I have been and what I have been before",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd when the sands of time run low\nCommemoration of a lonely crow\nThat would have made it throught the door",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLight and affection\nDarkness and pain\nMind of matter\nThe All's gonna make it all the same",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd when the final day has come\nAnother state of matter",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd when you face another sun\nUnion of the states of matter",
        "[Russell Allen]\nLight and affection\nDarkness and pain\nMind of matter\nThe All's gonna make it all the same"
