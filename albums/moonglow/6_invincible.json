        "[Geoff Tate]\nHold on tight\nYou don't let go\nBygone days bound to corrode",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nSentimental, poignant\nShady recollections slowly fade away\nBeckon to nothing",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAll had begun just with a dream\nWatered down\nSometimes you failed to feel",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nPushed around, you're losing ground\nThe sands of time they taint the instant\nA stifled fire\n\n[Geoff Tate]\nYou fade to nothing",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nWill you feel like you don't belong\nOr will you cease to feel at all",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThrow yourself into the waves\nLet 'em roll and carry you away into the sea\nTo wash off all fragility",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThrow yourself into the ocean\nJaded, blunt, invisible\nInvincible",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nThrow yourself into the waves\nLet 'em roll and carry you away into the sea\nTo wash away all fragility",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nThrow yourself into the ocean\nJaded, blunt, invisible\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nPlacid, numb and jaded",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nThrow yourself into the waves\nLet 'em roll\n\n[Geoff Tate & Tobias Sammet]\nAnd carry you away into the sea\nTo wash away all fragility",
        "[Geoff Tate & Tobias Sammet]\nThrow yourself into the ocean\nJaded, blunt\n\n[Goeff Tate]\nInvisible\nInvincible"
