        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nStaring into the lake, watching for heaven's sake\nFaces screaming in fear\nCrying like at the stake, in the fiery waves",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI can see all the souls how they suffer and howl\nIn their eternal pain\nService taking its toll, living life in hades",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAll the souls that left their mortal\nFrame if it's been dead or not\nAll the deaf who did not hear the truth",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nGet ready for the brimstone - getting blisters on the eyes\nThe power of the spirit was their final sacrifice",
        "[Jakob's voice]\nSomeone pullin' me out to come back to my flesh\nOr I'm going insane\nIn a world under Rome, in the fiery waves",
        "[Jakob's voice]\nCan't you see all the souls, how we suffer and howl\nIn our eternal pain\nService taking its toll, living life in hades",
        "[Jakob's voice]\nOh I see you standing on the shore of castigation now\nWe don't wann burn no more so pull us out, out, out",
        "[Jakob's voice]\nnGet ready for the brimstone - getting blisters on the eyes\nThe power of the spirit was their final sacrifice"
