        "[Eclipse]\nYou shed draconian love\nYou shed draconian...",
        "[Eclipse]\nWelcome to your way\nSeemingly endless as you take your wings",
        "[Eclipse]\nThe world through kaleidoscope eyes\nUntil you unlearn what you keep inside",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThose innocent eyes\nRefracting the light for an innocent soul\nTill the cold around's not gonna wait it's turn\nWait it's turn no more",
        "[Eclipse]\nTell me how should I embrace\nLike roses we'll wither on the vine\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nWhy should I bide my time\nIf it flies away sometine",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWhere are you now, where are you now\nLeaving me here, lost in the waves\n\n[Eclipse]\nHey hey hey\nWhen will God explain this draconian love",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWhere do I go, where are you now\nSelling me love through fiery rain, angel\n\n[Eclipse]\nWhen will you explain this draconian love",
        "[Eclipse]\nIt's all draconian love, it's all draconian",
        "[Eclipse]\nInfiltrate us with mercy\nBait us with sympathy\nBlind us with love",
        "[Eclipse]\nWe're lost in the clouds rolling by\nAnd in what some of us read\nInto what they feel",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nLike a grain of nothing\nI feel cast in the wind of enthean caprice\nOf an unbred cause, of an unborn will\nWhatever that may mean",
        "[Eclipse]\nTell me how should I embrace\nLike roses we'll wither on the vine\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nTell me why should I bide my time\nIf it flies away sometine",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAspiration and tears, heartache and fears\n\n[Eclipse]\nDraconian love, you shed draconian love",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nUnrequited love - down on my knees\n\n[Eclipse]\nDraconian love, it's all draconian",
        "[Eclipse\nWhere are you now, where are you now\nLeaving me here, lost in the waves\nWill you explain this draconian love",
        "[Aaron & Eclipse]\nWhere are you now, where are you now\nLeaving me down here lost in the waves\n\n[Eclipse]\nHey hey hey\nWhen will God explain this draconian love",
        "[Aaron & Eclipse]\nWhere do I go, where are you now\nSelling me love through fiery rain\n\n[Eclipse]\nHey hey hey\nWill you explain this draconian love"
