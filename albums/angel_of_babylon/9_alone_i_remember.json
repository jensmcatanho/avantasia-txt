    "lyrics": [
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI've been walking down this road\nWith a suitcase full of dreams\nI've seen my demons come and go\nTo show me what I need",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nMadness, walking dynamite\nBeen dancing on the edge\nThey got me by the fuse\nSmiling with a match",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI wanted love, I wanted life\nBeen striving for a new direction",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI wanted out, I wanted more\nI wanted to forget the damage left behind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBut I recall the dream I had\nWhen I kept moving on\nCan't stand to remember",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI recall\nNo turning back\nNow I'm moving on\nAlone I remember",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nRaise your head\nGot stars above and emptiness below\nThink of what you'd never had\nAnd would have never known",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou wanna turn your back on me\nCondemn this pleasure dome\nMake sure you won't regret\nMistaking friend for foe, no",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou're at the gates, you're on the edge\nI've seen them falling back to nowhere",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou're off the rail, out of your head\nAnd you will wish you'd never seen it all",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh and I recall I used to have a dream\nI won't forget that moment of glory"
