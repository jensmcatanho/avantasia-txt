        "[Cloudy Yang]\nTonight, tonight, tonight\nHeal me, heal me",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nYes in the darkness of the night\nI know there's someone near me\nI can't explain but it's all right\nAs long as this won't leave me",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nI give to you my sacrifice\nMy virgin creed, my passion\nI'm torn in two but all my life, my life",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nMy life I'll wait for you\nTo near me\nAnd reveal me",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nRush tonight\nWe play the darkest of all symphonies\nAnd in a flash of light\nThen it'll all become the symphony of life\nOf life, my life",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nHeal me",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nAnd in the deepness of my dreams\nI know it's you that haunts me\nIn blood I swear my purity\nAnd save my treasures for you",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nI give to you my sacrifice\nAnd lay my burden down\nAm I deranged that all my life, my life\nMy life I wait for you?",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nMy life I wait for you\nTo cease me\nAnd release me",
        "[Cloudy Yang]\nYou haunt me, chase me like a beast\nAnd with a taste so bittersweet\nYou love me, grieve me till I'm mad\nNow is the moment"
