        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWandering barefoot into nowhere\nJust another winter's night\nAnd I don't feel gravity anymore",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nYou'd never lie, never cry\nNever talk me out of dreams\nAnd a dream is what remains",
        "[Apparition]\nTell me don't you see what ain't there\nWhen you look in the mirror",
        "[Apparition]\nYou're starving away like a candle burning down\nMiles away, miles away\nYou;ve been cutting off the rope\nLetting go and losing ground",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd I wonder who's to blame\nAs I sleepwalk in the rain\nIt's my, my silent victory over gravity\nAnd I sleepwalk in the rain",
        "[Aaron Blackwell & Apparition]\nWinter sky far and wide\nCaving in on you and me\nLike a brittle wall of the emerald room",
        "[Aaron Blackwell & Apparition]\nThe hall of fame and dying dreams\nThe love we'd die for: Petrified\nI wanna know: Does a frozen river flow",
        "[Aaron Blackwell & Apparition]\nAnd I wonder who's to blame\nAs I sleepwalk in the rain\nIt's my, my silent victory over gravity\nAnd I sleepwalk in the rain"
