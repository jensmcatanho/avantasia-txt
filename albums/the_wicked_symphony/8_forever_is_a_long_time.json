        "[Jørn Lande]\nYoung is the day\nStill it's the same\nThe same old tomorrow",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nColors too bright\nSo dream in black and white\nIf you wanna rise from the hollow",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nThe future in sight\nThe past in your head\nNightmare or treason",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nThe father above you as you\nWalk through the ashes\nDon't you run out of reason",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou keep on waiting\nFor your choice to be made\nThere ain't no bounty\nFor the number of passions\nYou rein in for love",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou are defying the devil\nForever this time\nBut you can't imagine\nForever will drag on a long long time",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou are defing salvation\nThe wait is your crime\nStalemate in virtue we falter\nForever is a long time",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nPleasure and pain fell all the same\nTo the dreamer who's trying to get closer",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nStrange how it feels in reality\nWhen your fairytale is over",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNo right or wrong\nI just keep going on\nAnd I don't get lost in belief",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFalter and pray\nKeep looking away\nI don't wanna see"
