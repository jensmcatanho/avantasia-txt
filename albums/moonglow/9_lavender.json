        "[Bob Catley]\nThey were taking small pains to not make you realise\nMade him feel he's different through and through",
        "[Bob Catley]\nA monster in his own way\nCommunicative quarantine\nUnleashed on the world without a clue",
        "[Bob Catley]\nSurrounded by the ghosts of paling pictures\nThey come and slipe away",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nVivid memories roll and spin\nIf only they would suck me in",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWe're going up like a fire in just a blink between the dream\nAnd the memories and the embers of what we'd hoped it all would be",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nBreathing odour of lavender and it's all coming back to me\nWish I didn't fail to say those words before you'd have to leave",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nnWish I didn't fail to say those words before you'd have to leave",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWish I didn't fail to say those words before you'd have to leave\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nA soul, a storm, a joruney across the waves",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHere I stand and survey what the Father's cast my way\nA wind got up to bode times of change",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI close the door behind me\nKnow the day break is too far\n\n[Tobias Sammet & Bob Catley]\nMe and who I was:\nAlone, enstranged",
        "[Bob Catley]\nSurrounded by the scent invoking pictures\nGone and yet so clear",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nBreathing odour of lavender and it's all coming back to me\nWish I didn't have to see now what back then I didn't see",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWish I didn't have to see now what back then I didn't see",
        "[Bob Catley & Tobias Sammet]\nWish I didn't have to see now what back then I didn't see\n\n[Bob Catley]\nA soul, a storm, a joruney across the waves",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe crazy part ain't dreaming, wishing on a falling star\nIt is the world that's in between the cope and you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI close my eyes and see a magic world in sepia\nThat cast me out onto a road without a clue",
        "[Bob Catley]\nWe're going up like a fire in just a blink between the dream\nAnd the memories and the embers of what we'd hoped it all would be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nA soul, a storm, a journey across the waves\n\n[Bob Catley]\nA soul, a storm, a journey across the waves"
