        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou're awake in your darkest dream\nI have come for you\n\n[Klaus Meine]\nAnd nobody can hear you scream\nWhen I reach for you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't you remember their feet in your face\nBefore they have carved you in stone",
        "[Klaus Meine]\nAnd don't you remember your sweat and your pain\nWhen you were drawn to the bone\nWhen you were left all alone",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Klaus Meine]\nLiving on a dream\nDying for an angel\nReach out, waiting for a miracle\nNo sign of wings as you turn your back on me",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Klaus Meine]\nLiving on a dream\nLonely, cold and dire\nHead up, feet down in the fire\nGiving till you're gone\nDying for an angel everyday",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhere do we go from the apogee\nWhat do we live behind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd how will I stand what I'll have to see\nThis reflection of mine",
        "[Klaus Meine]\nCollateral damage: your sacrifice\nGotta learn to fly, unlearn to fall",
        "[Klaus Meine]\nGotta tear down the walls of love and lies\nYou have come on your own\nYou will go all alone"
