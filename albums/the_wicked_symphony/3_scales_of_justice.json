        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nPredetermination, belief\nVeracity of incidents\nReconciliation between justice and tomorrow\nYou're innocent",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nIt's only human to just close your eyes\nBlinding fury, part of paradise\nHeaven justifies",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nTo take your eyes off the drag\nWalking to the block\nAt the scaffold scales held even",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nTake your eyes off the drag\nWalking to the block\nLook away, scales held even",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nYou owe the power and your pace\nTo the brute that's running after you",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nHumiliation's growing hate\nRighteous anger driving you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nCut off the hand\nThat tries to keep me back\nBlinding fury, a piece of paradise\nCause heaven justifies",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nJust close your eyes, just look away\nWhat you don't want to know\nAin't gonna hurt you",
        "[Tim \"Ripper\" Owens]\nTime passes by, we all die anyway\nAnd no nothing remains\nWhatever you say, whatever you do"
