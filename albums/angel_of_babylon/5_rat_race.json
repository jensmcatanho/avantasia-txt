        "[Jorn Lande]\nThere'll be fireworks tonight\nEverybody is on their knees\nAdmiration for the one\nRiot in a dead end street",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nDon't be afraid to hear his voice\nTells your lies you wanna hear",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou just listen and obey\nGot the ticket in your hand\nA new religion for the mob\nFor everyone to understand",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe're all just clockwork toys tonight\nAnd salvation is drawing near",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe snow covered opera tonight\nEnchanted with dilated eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLiving in a rat race\nDying in a rat race\nBurning in the stream again\nWhy should I dare to break away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI got sulfur in my veins\nDevil watching through my eyes\nI got beauty I got brains\nAnd there's no one to defy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI've got the power in my fingers\nAnd the opera in my hands",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe onset of winter tonight\nThe mirror it gives me a smile",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nSpeeding in the rat race\nBleeding in the rat chase\nBurning in the stream again\nWhy should I dare to break away"
