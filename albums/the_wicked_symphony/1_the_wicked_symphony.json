    "lyrics": [
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou'll be running out of miracles\nLike I'm running out of dreams\nMadness lurking to my left\nAngels faint in front of me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd I see eyes to the right\nI hear a promise resound\nGold and diamonds, love and fame\nAnd music meant to remain",
        "[Russell Allen]\nYou've been dying for glory\nYou've been looking for love\nWhy don't we read the signs\nWhen we're about to get lost",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nA seeker enthralled by a flame\nEventually home to his pain\nThe Great Unbeloved\nYou reach for the final stage",
        "Hey man in your hideaway\nWhere do we go from here\nHeroes in a tragedy\nDown-home just a memory\nWhere do we go\nWhen the world gets in the way",
        "Way down to the hide away\nAfflatus Divine! Your hands\nAnd a wicked symphony\nHey now to the hideaway\nLock up the rain for a wicked symphony",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nDon't you give up on your emotions\nDon't you abandon your despair\nIf you deny what you desire\nThis will have been just a mystery play",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThere'll be nowhere to go\nJust oblivion, we're so close to reach out\nClose to fall, make up or break up or crawl",
        "[Russell Allen]\nYou are striving for beauty\nFor a song to remain\nA final touch and the spirit you have cited\nHolds on to the reins",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI feel how I'm losing my ground\nA dancer enthralled by a sound\nThe smoke clears away\nI'll reach for the final stage",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, I can hear it, I can hear it\nOh, I can hear it, I, I, I, I...\nI can hear it, yeah\nI'm dying for a sign",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou can turn your face away\nCan pretend you don't hear it",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHow long have you been\nBegging on your knees\nAnd now that you're near it",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWon't you be damned\nIf you defy what you're given\nMercury of salvation",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe colors for the eyes of the world\nWe'll be kings for generations"
