        "[Michael Kiske]\nA moment of glory\nThe blink of an eye and it's all gone\nYou hide in confinement\nDark is the cell that you call home",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nWe pretend to be blind\nEverytime it hurts to see",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nYou - you close your eyes\nTo blink the night away\nAt ease in the wastelands",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nYou - you're dead and blind\nYou sanctify the way\nBlindfold in the wastelands",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't tell me in pain\nThe end doesn't justify the means\nSpado, ascetic\nIt's easy to sermonize in jealousy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNow I'm off to life\nI'm changing sides\nYour final goodbye",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou - you close your eyes\nTo blink the tears away\nLove hurts in the wastelands",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou - you're old and blind\nYou sacrifice it all\nLost in the wastelands"
