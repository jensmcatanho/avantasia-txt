        "[Bob Catley]\nRousing from dreams, craving for someone\nWept himself to sleep\nHe's waiting for a sign from above\nWhere is the love?",
        "[Bob Catley]\nThe hourglass in pieces, dashed to the wall\nThe future is over\nTomorrow's been slipping away\nAnd nothing remains",
        "[Bob Catley]\nHe'd known it won't last forever\nShe'd go ahead for a while",
        "[Bob Catley]\nWhen you open your eyes\nWhen you gaze at the sky\nWhen you look to the stars\nAs they shut down the night\nYou know this story ain't over",
        "[Bob Catley]\nWhen you open your eyes\nWhen you gaze at the sky\nWhen you look to the stars\nAs they shut down the night\nYou feel this story ain't over",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhere is the candle in this lonesome night?\nAngel why are you so wayward\nAbandoning me, try my belief?",
        "[Bob Catley]\nWhen life is not words\nAnd tongue is not answers\nAnd we only can't see a reason\nWhy would it mean\nThat it's not meant to be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen you open your eyes\nWhen you gaze at the sky\nWhen you look to the stars\nAs they shut down the night\nYou know this story ain't over",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen you open your eyes\nWhen you gaze at the sky\nWhen you look to the stars\nAs they shut down the night\nYou feel this story ain't over",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nThe story ain't over\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nStory ain't over"
