        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nFrom a world of reign they come...",
        "[Pope Clemens IIX]\nIn a world of mammon we have found it all\nFighting for pride and for gold\nBut the key to the reign, to the ultimate control:\nWisdom of the old",
        "[Pope Clemens IIX]\nWe have been elect to drain the wine\nOf Gnosis to hide it and pray\nGot to save our children from the beast\nWe are on the way",
        "[Elderane]\nRemaining in darkness\nThe land of salvation will drown\nAnd when we'll have vanished\nSlavery will take your freedom down",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSeven eyes to be blind forever in time:\nSign of the cross\nHell arise! Castigation under the sign\nSign of the cross - make us drown in altar wine",
        "[Falk von Kronberg]\nIn the heart of justice called Horeb long ago\nMoses got carvings in stone\nImposed to judge those who do not fear\nThe only, the holy, the lord",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nThe blood of anger and pain:\nInk of the Old Testament\nI know they'll end their crusade\nDrown in the blood of the lamb",
        "[Regrin]\nYou have been the chosen one\nSo welcome to this place\nVandroiy's told us you would come\nTo help us win the race\nBring back the seal from the men\nWho don't know what they do",
        "[Regrin]\nSeemed to be a fool without an own way of life\nBut you've been a sleeping mind\nAnd you woke up on time\nYou've got the power to save us and finally you",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nA dream is forever\nThe land of salvation can't drown\nThese enchanting colors\nWho could have the might to tear it down"
