        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI remember it was long ago\nBut when I think of her I feel it grow",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSomething begs me to come home again\nSomething I can hardly stand",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nBut I'm to defy, I have to ignore her cry\nI don't know what to do, I'm missing you so bad",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWaiting for tomorrow, for a little ray of light\nWaiting for tomorrow, just to see your smile again",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nTake away my sorrow from a blistered heart of mine\nWhere are you now if you are there anywhere",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nPlease forgive me for how I decide\nBut before I can come with rapid strides",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDon't expect you'll have to understand\nJakob needs my helping hand",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nFirst I have to go one out of two ways\nWhich both are wrong and I'm to go",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSo afraid, so ashamed\nSo deranged - but I know"
