    "lyrics": [
        "[Spirit]\nA genuine soul to dwell on baleful grounds\nGlances wandering around\nIn the darkness of the world",
        "[Spirit]\nClouds have closed a ring around the sky\nWhile the old ones hear the chimes\nThrough the darkness of the world",
        "[Spirit]\nA genunine man will realize\nHe must fawn upon the times\nWhile he shouldn't waste a word",
        "[Spirit]\nTender feet on a stoney ground\nSee the young ones stray around\nThrough the darkness of the world",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nSacred heart will you usher me now\nFor I'll carry the lantern your way\nFor I'll bring us home",
        "[Spirit]\nDark is the night, scarlet the moon\nSacred the light in the haze reflecting within\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nBlazing the trail",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBe still my restless heart\nObsidian's the sky\nInward you look as you halt\n\n[Spirit]\nBe still restless heart",
        "[Spirit]\nBe still restless heart\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'm on my way\n\n[Spirit]\nUnder obsidian skies",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWake to the sound of passing time\nHow could I quantify it\nIn the darkness of the world",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWake to the shadow of a dream\nNothing's what it seems\nAs you brave the darkness of the world",
        "[Spirit]\nGhost lights and matter\nYou'll know what is real\nPerception and fact: All the same\nTruth's what you feel",
        "[Spirit]\nAnd the wind and the rain that were shaking the pane move onward along with the clouds\nAnd you're gazing in awe at the ghost lights above\nAs if stars cut their way through the shroud\nOn and on and on",
        "[Spirit]\nMoon shines\nGhost lights\nOh, they reach out for you\nBlazing the trail under obsidian skies"
