        "[Muse]\nFrom a frozen world will you take me over\nAll alone, sweet embrace\nLeave the place I can't abide no more",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTake a look at ourselves\nAfraid to get closer",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWill the predermination drive us to a distant shore\n\n[Muse]\nThe tender velvet gown of destination left behind",
        "[Aaron & Muse]\nI'm wide awake\nI'm on my way to evermore\n\n[Muse]\nAnd I turn around to fading shores\nI'll sail on through this opening door",
        "[Aaron & Muse]\nWide awake onto the Isle of Evermore\n\n[Muse]\nI'm dead to the world\nYou blindfold my eyes\nWhile you're killing what I'm yearning for",
        "[Muse]\nYou just see what your eyes\nHave been told to tell you",
        "[Muse]\nFalling down to the ground\nHow come you ask if what you feel is true",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'm staring at the maze and let it paralyze me\nWatch it come alive\nAnd burn me out until I'm coming through",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe tender velvet gown of slumber\nWill leave my just breathing"
