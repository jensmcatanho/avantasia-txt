        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNever been told my prayers would be answered\nWherever I go I see you around",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNever been told that something that beautiful\nWould bring me up to let me down",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWaiting up on the roof, waiting up in the rain\nJust to catch a glimpse of your face",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nEven when you're around\nStill I'm out of sight, out of sound\nIn your world I'm out of place",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nCarry me over\nCarry me over\nCarry me over now",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou're like a ghost that I can't let go\nYou follow every step that I take",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNever thought someone could be too close to you\nNow across the street is miles away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAn now I might as well be the man in the moon\nI am watching but you don't seem aware",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBut I won't be around\nI'll be out of sight - out of sound\nSomeone's gonna wait somewhere"
