        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDay after day I see her smile\nIf you could see her through my eyes\nYou wouldn't call her a little boy's fever dream",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHow can you tell my feelings wrong\nHow can't you see it's growing strong\nSilicone angel you are my fantasy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYour eyes are cold\nPale are your skin and your lips\nPale is your desire",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou are the one\nDay after day I'm under your spell\nAnd you look away\nYour love is evil",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou are the one\nDay after day\nYou are the rain\nI'm the parade\nThough your love is evil",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI feel how you watch my every move\nWhy do you lie to me and you\nYour languidness shining through a crystal wall",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNobody would touch you like I would\nNobody would stop us\nIf I could reach out through the glass\nPretend you don't hear my call"
