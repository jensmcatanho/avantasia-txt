        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI spy with my little eye\nThings you'll never see\nWhispers burn my eardrum\nIt's eerie to the feel",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI see them crawling up the wall\nI see them staring at us all\nAm I afraid of what I know",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThey look at you, they look at me\nAnd as they look inquiringly\nThey scratch their heads\nAnd watch the show",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI can't explain, am I ashamed",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nScary eyes watching every move\nFail to make out a reason",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nScary eyes tracing what we do\nAt the tail of us fools",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nExtraterrestrial you follow me around\nNot that I don't like you\nBasically you're sound",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWelcome to the Stone Age\nDon't ask me to explain\nOr you will crash the headlines:\nMartian gone insane",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI can't explain why you're insane",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhy are you afraid of little spider\nNot a claudication\nOr other complication",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhy don't you just be a little wiser\nYou stick in relation\nInstead of fornication"
