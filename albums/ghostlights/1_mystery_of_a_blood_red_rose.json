        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWe've played our roles in our passion plays\nThey've imposed on us right from the cradle",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNo matter what you dream\nBeware of what you say\nUntil the cogwheel's out of control\nTo burst out of place",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNo time to breathe\nDOn't have no time to waste\nBring on the night\nSeize every drop of life away",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nSlice a tasty hour off from\nOr in a blink it will be gone\nA stranding future bring it on",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nMystery of a Blood Red Rose\nBurning like a raging fire\nWhen the day's been torn apart we'll leave it behind",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nMystery of a Blood Red Rose\nFeasting on a blind desire\nLet the scent of poisonous flowers tempt me away",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA sweet temptation and a pure red rose\nWhile the hour don't wait for a blink to cram the past\nI'll get a move on",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNo hesitation makes no one a better man\nI can't wait to finally know now\nWhat is gonna show now in",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBoy, reach out for what is due\nOr you'll lap up what's left of you",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThrow ourselves into the waves\nAnd as the grinding wheel of time\nIs grinding out the chimes\nTo echo in the night",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd I will waste no time tonight\nAnd I don't waste no time at all tonight"
