        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't we all keep moving on\nAs we try to spell forevermore",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI have been searching, where I was told\nDidn't find myself around the bend",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, I tried to run forever in a lonely charade",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBack on my way, hot on the trail again\nAfraid of moving closer to my heart",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI would always do anything\nAlways tried to believe I can\nI was burning down inside to play my part",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAre we meant to feel ok as we stray in someone else's dream?",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBurning with honour and pride - for glory and fame\nThe duty of love is not to faint along the way"
