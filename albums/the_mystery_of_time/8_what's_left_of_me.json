        "[Nameless beggar]\nI think of the days\nI was thrilled by this road ahead\nWhen the moment won over what was to come",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nNot afraid of the distance but the distance afraid of me\nEverytime I made it there I found nothing\nThe distance was gone",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nNow, I don't wanna fade\nBut I ain't gonna run\nI'm resting my head on these stones\nGod, what have you done to you and me",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nI'm tired of scaring the future away\nNo road ahead, the fire is dead",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nFather don't you see in front of you\nIs what the chase has left of me",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nIf only they told me\nWhat the kerbside was hiding away\nWhere the angels from high street didn't want to go",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nAnd a heartbeat is forced\nTo resign the glory of a commonplace\nI am jaded",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI don't wanna see what's becoming of me\nHere's a bit! Then spare me this sight now",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nCut it out, I'm tired of the future myself",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nI don't wanna fade but I ain't gonna run\nI'm resting my head on these stones\nGod, what have you done to you and me",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nFather don't you see\nIn front of you is what's left of me",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nGod and glory torn to pieces\nNo no, it's just the spirit of the times",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'm drawn to a flame that won't release me\nRelease me!\nAnd I see a thousand who wait in line",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nI don't wanna face what I ain't gonna stand\nAnd won't rest my head on these stones\nGod, what have you done, look at yourself",
        "[Nameless beggar]\nI'm tired of scaring the future away\nThe dark road ahead, the fire is dead\nFather don't you see what you have made of me"
