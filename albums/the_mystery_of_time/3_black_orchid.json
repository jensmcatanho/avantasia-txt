        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI never wanted guidance\nTo tell me where to find\nA light in the darkness\nCause the dark I'd push aside",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNo time for dreaming of a distant Paradise\nNo time for tales of good and evil",
        "[Reason]\nAnother correlation: as above so below",
        "[Reason]\nAnother analysing where illusions fail to show\nThe face of the maker who'd leave you alone\nWithout a sense of comprehension",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWhen that meadow - in front of my eyes - will have dried away\nWill my senses wither like flowers on my grave",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWill this wave of becoming flow into the void of time",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe final hour:\nWhen Never and Now become one\nWill I find the orchid?",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe final hour:\nDoor to the garth of eternity?\nOr withered orchid meadows?",
        "[Reason]\nEverybody's praying\nBut what if God is just a threat\nAnd everybody's straying?\nIf only they would just forget",
        "[Reason]\nEverybody's craving\nFor a ghost light in the haze:\nYou'll lose your minds one after another",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nEverybody's craving\nFor what doesn't have a name or a face\nSo reason could fit it in the frame",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nIn quest for the orchid:\nA glivver in the daze\nTill I awake to the sound of rigour",
        "[Reason]\nWhat if that meadow in your mind is just a fantasy?\nAnd if it wanted to be seen why must you believe?",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWill this wave of becoming flow into the void of time?",
        "[Reason]\nThe final hour\nWhen Never and Now become one\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nWill I find the orchid?",
        "[Reason]\nThe final hour\nDoor to the garth of eternity\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nOr withered orchid meadows",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBlack orchid\nStrange and beautiful\nOh, black orchid, I must find you",
        "[Reason]\nI remember that morning\nHe had to be told\nWhat he could'nt remember\nAfter he'd spoken to the wall",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd I gave to repression\nWhat I must not have seen\nWhen even believers\nMust unlearn to unbelieve"
