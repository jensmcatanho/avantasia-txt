        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWho's got the answer\nIs this what I'm looking for\nAnd who do I talk to\nWhat do I have to explore",
        "[Magician]\nAttend to your god given duty\nYou'll be taking tour heaven by force",
        "[Magician]\nHow could you choose\nWith your head in the noose\nWith no time to lose",
        "[Mystic]\nHigh up in the open skies\n\n[Magician]\nWe'll chain the light\nWe'll take the time from those it does to death",
        "[Mystic]\nHight up in the open skies\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nWe'll chain the light\nWe'll take the time from those it does to death",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWe'll chain the light\nWe'll take the time from those it does to death and I'll chain the light\nI'll bring it right down to illuminate unholy ways",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWe'll chain the light",
        "[Magician]\nToo worn out to wonder\nWe might not want to overextend them no more",
        "[Magician]\nOur beautiful spook lights are all they will need\nAll they will want to explore",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd after it's all said and done\nWe won't fear the trascience no more",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nCause we don't realize\nIdle glance in our eyes\nLet precision prevail",
        "[Mystic]\nYou look above to see inside yourself and find time standing still\nYou see the world in different light\nYou turn this moment into what you think it's ought to be\nDemistify the dark"
