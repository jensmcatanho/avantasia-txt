        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI sold my soul for diamonds\nAnd reason for acclaim\nBeen begging for white angels\nTo blow my mind away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBeen growing funny flowers\nWhere roses never grew",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI stayed awake all night\nWhen I woke up from dreams\nOf me and you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI tried to take the sun and I went blind\nGod help me to erase you from my mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm growing cold\nAnd the night is yet to come",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnyone tell me is this\nThe way it's meant to be\nLost and isolated\nI'm way too complicated\nFor you to lean on me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI play a losing game\nI cried in desperation\nMental devastation\nI'm blowing out the flame",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou never tried to take a look\nAt the one I'd have died to be\nNow it seems you don't see me at all",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWas it all worth it, visions holding sway\nWhen the real thing got lost along the way",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYes anyone tell me is this\nThe way it's meant to be\nLost and isolated\nI'm way too complicated\nFor you to lean on me"
