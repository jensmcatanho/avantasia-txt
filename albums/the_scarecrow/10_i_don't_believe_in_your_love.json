        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nNo one around to hear your cries\nNo one there to even realize you grit your teeth",
        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nWhat are you afraid to lose when you're left alone\nI'm the one to make you anything you wanna be",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNever broke the silence\nNever broke the ice\nNo more waiting\nI gotta wipe her off my mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLoving her is dying\nLoving her is pain\nBabylon I'm coming\nReady for the fray",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI don't believe in your love\nTread on this bed of roses\nI don't believe in your love\nDon't give a fuck for roses\n\n[Oliver Hartmann]\nDon't give a damn for roses - no no no",
        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nYou've been standing on the edge\nLost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy",
        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nTake your share boy sraightaway\nIt's all heavensent",
        "[Oliver Hartmann]\nShe won't care:\nThey call their love divine but it's all evil",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLoving you was bleeding\nSo I had to break away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDarkness stretching out its hand\nTo save me from your sway\nCause loving you was wasting\nLoving you was pain\nNow angel of temptation\nOpen up the gate"
