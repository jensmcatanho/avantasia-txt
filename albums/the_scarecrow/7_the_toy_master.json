        "[Alice Cooper]\nDon't you be afraid\nCome and step inside and take a look around",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nI'm your holy grail in your candy store\nTo save you from the profound",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nThey use to dream in only black and white\nCan't you hear them scream drowning in the tide",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nOut in the cold I see water frozen in ther eyes\nWhat a sorry sight",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nI am willing to believe they would pay for a smile",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nI'm the master of toys\nAnd all you girls and boys\nAre welcome to my wonderland\nI'm the angel of joy\nAnd I'm here to paint the void\nWelcome to my world\nTo my dream factory",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nSay hello to the gentle man with the paint\nThe deeper you're in the blue\nThe sweeter the sound of your plaint",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nIf only I had a heart it would break - oh sure\nAnd I'd wonder how much more they can take",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOut in the cold I see water frozen in their eyes\nWhat a sorry sight",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI am willing to believe they would pay for a smile",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nI'm dealing in pain and a little Novocaine\nWelcome to my world, to my toy factory",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNo more struggle of the classes\nNo more struggle of the masses\nOn their knees - conformity",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThey are ready for a hero\nThey are flying at zero\nIt's their turn to crash and burn",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nNo more struggle of the classes\nNo more struggle of the masses\nOn their knees - conformity",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nThey are ready for a hero\nThey are flying at zero\nIt's their turn to crash and burn",
        "[Alice Cooper]\nI come to bring you pain\nAnd a little Novocaine\nWelcome to my world"
