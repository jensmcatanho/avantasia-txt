    "lyrics": [
        "[Bob Catley]\nA lonely boy, a handful of dreams\nCold wind blows through a heart wired in",
        "[Bob Catley]\nOpen skies he would explore\nNo, there ain't no mastery\nOf a passing and a deep blue love",
        "[Bob Catley]\nYearn to see far away places\nOne day he'd feel two hearts collide",
        "[Bob Catley]\nIn his eyes tears and desire\nBut he prays and he swears every night\nOne day scales will fall from her eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nJust with a dream\nJust with a dream and with a song",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOn my own I may stumble and fall\nIt don't matter at all when you're blessed with\nJust what's yet to come, what's yet to come",
        "[Bob Catley]\nBurning feet on the ground\nGot your head in the clouds\nYou're out to find Arcadia",
        "[Bob Catley]\nAnd you know you will stand\nWhat you can't comprehend\nJourney to Arcadia",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe more I've seen I understand\nThat there ain't nothing that I know\nAs I awake on padded ground\nThe final curtain of the show",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen dogs run barking and I don't hear no sound\nAnd the sky is as blue as eyes have never seen it\nThen I remember what I'd have been dying for",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFaith rescue my dream\nFrom a role that I've been put in\nOn their screen",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYour eyes, and as I'll look into your eyes\nWe're at the crack of dawn\nLife will stop telling lies\nAnd destiny will know\nIt's just you and I",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nBurning feet on the ground\nGot my head in the clouds\nJourney to Arcadia",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd I know I will stand\nWhat I can't comprehend\nJourney to Arcardia",
        "[Bob Catley]\nThe more we see we understand\nThat there's a lot that we don't know\nAs you awake on padded ground\nThe final curtain of the show",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFar from eye but close to heart\nNo matter how we try\nCan't repel the counterpart\nOur common bond we can't defy",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOh, wishing on an angel",
        "[Russell Allen]\nI've seen them standing at the crossroads\nWhen they were waiting for a sign",
        "[Russell Allen]\nAnd they unlearned to face the silence\nAs they unlearned to turn inside",
        "[Russell Allen]\nYou're turning to the sky\nAnd you're dying for an angel",
        "[Russell Allen]\nIf you want it bad enough\nSee those eyes\nThat's where two glances collide",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLearn to breathe, learn to crawl\nLearn to stand, walk and fall",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLearn to lose and to love\nTo believe, rise above\nLove is more than to love"
