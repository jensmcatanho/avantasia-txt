        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nI've been here through a million ages\nI am the savior inside",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nTonight I am love and justice\nTomorrow perversion to spite",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nAnd now that it's bleeding you dry\nI'm calling you, I'm calling you",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nWhen temperance is bleeding you dry\nI'm knocking you off the perch",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd out in the rain\nI'll hide under wings\nI'd curse in sunlight",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOut in the rain\nYou can break me and take me away\nOn wings of fury",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nLive your tragic comedy\nI'm the poison in your veins\nCircumspection, vanity\nYou give all they can take",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nI am fury, I am fire, I'm the worm inside\nDeliver you from self-denial tonight",
        "[Ralf Zdiarstek]\nWhen temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWho do you think you are\nTo tell me what to say",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWho do you think you are\nTo tell me what to play\nAnd what not to break",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen temperance is bleeding you dry, I'm inside"
