        "[Nightmare]\nI can't count the days I've roamed\nA strange ghost light to wither on the vine",
        "[Nightmare]\nA paling tale of days long gone\nI won't be until you close your eyes",
        "[Nightmare]\nSleep tight, someone's always by your side",
        "[Nightmare]\nA thousand nights\nWe've been calling your name\nClose your eyes but I won't go away\nWe're there for you",
        "[Nightmare]\nThe cold embrace\nThat you don't wanna feel\nMust not be... but you know it is real\nWe're there for you",
        "[Nightmare]\nDon't you waste your time and try\nTo understand this figment of the lie",
        "[Nightmare]\nDon't breathe a word to anyone\nBy the time you'll phrase me I'll be gone",
        "[Nightmare]\nSweet dreams, see you in the twilight zone",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nGod I must contain my wayward fantasy\nAnd where do all those\nWicked dreams come from",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nPictures in the dark\nThey seem so eerily real tonight\nI pray my mind is wrong",
        "[Nightmare]\nI'm the spark they refuse to conceive"
