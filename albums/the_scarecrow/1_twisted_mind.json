        "[Roy Khan]\nOne of a kind they say\nThey've never seen before\nInvestigate the aberration\nDisorder in the core",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI never tried to hide away\nOr tried to keep your pace\nYou walk me to the slaughter\nWith a smile upon your face",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFrom the cradle to the madhouse\nA twisted mind\nThere's no way of this hell for\nA twisted mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThere's no way out\nThere's no way out",
        "[Roy Khan]\nYou've come to see the healer\nSo don't you be afraid\nThey call me tranquilizer\nI'm here to isolate",
        "[Roy Khan]\nWe paint in black and white\nAnd you're the dirty in between\nMonstrosity of nature\nA virulent disease",
        "[Roy Khan]\nCan't you see - Can't you see\nThat you're not like anyone",
        "[Roy Khan]\nYou'll never see\nThrough anyone else's eyes",
        "[Roy Khan]\nAnd who am I to certify\nThe sanity of a twisted mind\nA victim of perception\nA twisted mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nMisprizing - chastizing\nSubhuman fragmentizing\nSensation - aberration\nRepulsive - tantalizing"
