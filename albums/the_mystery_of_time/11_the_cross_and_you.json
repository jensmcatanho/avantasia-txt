        "[Tobias Sammet]\nScreaming in silence you must carry\nYour secrets down this lonely eerie wicked road",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nScreaming you're so battle weary\nThey say it's lonely at the top\nLet alone when you hit the ground",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAll ablaze, you're rushing down the tightrope\nWith you only mean companion ticking away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou gotta stand your ground\nForge into a fiery fierce tomorrow\nStand your ground\nAt the speed of light into the void",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHell is what you've gotta make it through\nUntil it's just the cross and you\nThe cross and you",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nScreaming from behind the mask of reason\nThe cautionary voice that shatters your brain",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe silvery gleam of tomorrow\nKeep accelerating in quest for a break\nUntil you realize that it's too late",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAll ablaze I plough my way\nTill I am allowed to fall\nI pay my dues on a ship of fools\nI kick and scream and fight and crawl",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGet a life! Don't waste time!\nAs we drown the voice inside\nTill the moment I awake\nWhen it's just the cross and me"
