        "[Falk von Kronberg]\nJesus Christ I'm coming - terrestrial home\nI'm allowed to guide their train\nTo visit you in Rome",
        "[Falk von Kronberg]\nI am sick of preachers telling to be plain\nWhile you got it nice in here\nThey'd better feel ashamed",
        "[Johann Adam von Bicken]\nOh, ways of gold\nLead us into your blaze of fame\nOh, are you waiting\nFor what we have brought you from hell?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nGlory of Rome, glorious home\nPraising the king of the kings\nGlory of Rome, glorious home\nReaching for haloes and wings",
        "[Johann Adam von Bicken]\nHeading for the angels, heading for the feast\nHeading for salvation and the ruing of the beast",
        "[Johann Adam von Bicken]\nLet us fight the outcast, let us bring 'em fire\nLet us lock the center of their wicked, mad desire",
        "[Johann Adam von Bicken]\nOh, ways of gold\nLead us into your blaze of fame\nOh, are you waiting\nFor what we have brought you from hell?",
        "[Pope Clemens IIX]\nHolding in my hand: Seven parts of a seal\nTo unlock the land of illumination I feel",
        "[Pope Clemens IIX]\nAnd it's been foretold: After touching the kight\nWe shall lock the world\nBut now it's our time to transcend\nThe ultimate key in our hand"
