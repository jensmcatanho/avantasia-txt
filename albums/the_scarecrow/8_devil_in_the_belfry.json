    "lyrics": [
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI dropped off in the shadows\nThe lead of a tragedy\nI open my eyes - blind by the spotlight\nAnd what do I see",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nPushed by ambition\nYou've been granted admission\nTo the hall of acclaim",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nShe denied your affection\nNow listen the whole world\nIs screaming your name",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI will forget her but I won't forgive\nThe curtain has fallen\nBehold the messiah",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRiding high\nThe devil in the crest\nFor all the world to see forevermore",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI am I - the devil in the belfry\nI'll be glorified forevermore",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nIs it a sin to learn to be able\nTo live without love\nAnd is it a sing to put love under will\nAnd control from above",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDevil in my fingers - pleasure at my feet\nMind out of sight\nThe shadow I'll cast shall darken her world\nAnd ghost her at night",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWith each song you'll die a little for me\nIt won't leave a scar\nCause I've drawn the curtain",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nInto the opera like moths to the flame\nSpellbind their senses to follow the hero"
