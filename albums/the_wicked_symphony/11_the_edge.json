        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen I was sent to walk this long cold way\nI'd never meant to take it all this far",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNobody told me I was bound to stray\nYou gave me visions and cut out this part",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen the journey is over\nThen what will remain\nBut a churchyard of angels",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't need no glory\nThe bottle and I\nDon't need no sympathy at all\nAs I hang on the edge",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't need no glory\nTill the river's run dry\nI won't cry for sympathy as I\nHang on the edge",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen your were shackles chances passed me by\nI've broken free\nNow I'm free falling",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLaid down my arms as you laid down the lies\nThose words you didn't say when I was calling",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFingers bleed onto the ivory\nThey dance on the keys\nTo a churchyard of angels"
