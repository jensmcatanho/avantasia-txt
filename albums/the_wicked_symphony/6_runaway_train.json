        "[Bob Catley]\nGoodbye\nYour pocket full of dreams\nYour mind in a daze\nKeep on chasing rainbows",
        "[Bob Catley]\nFly high\nLeave the past behing\nThe dark road you take bears no scape",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nIn a world of grand illusions\nWhere love is just a dream\nYou gotta make your sacrifices\nTime to pick your poison",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThe fool is he who is noble minded\nAnd bellies up to poverty",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nHe's not a king in a world of diamonds\nPaling into oblivion",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI lay down my soul for glory\nI've given a life away\nDon't know if I am sorry\nBlind me, blind me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't know where I'll be going\nI gotta get away\nFrom the pain of recollection\nDrawn into the faint",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHang on to a runaway train\nNo turning back",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTethered to a runaway train\nTake me away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nTorpid in the wind and rain\nNo turning back",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHang on to a runaway train\nTake me away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf I'm a stranger to myself\nThen I better gotta stay away\nEven better gotta get away, get away\nTime to pick my poison",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel the devil sitting in my neck\nStraight ahead into the unknown\nOh father I forgive you for I\nDon't know what I'm doing",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nIt's only human nature\nTo keep away from pain\nTake a train to ecstacy oh\nRide on, ride on",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nInhale the scent of heaven\nRespire the smell of fame\nYou've been to hell and back\nYou can't change things anyway, no",
        "[Bob Catley]\nReaching out to rule the world\nYou'll watch the mirror shatter\nAs you'll be dazzled by the sight\nOnce only diamons mattered",
        "[Bob Catley]\nHow can you justify the way\nWhen you wake up screaming\nWill you pretend that you were blind\nWhen you were really seeing",
        "[Bob Catley]\nYour image everywhere\nThe looking glass: A sheet of ice\nIt's thick enough to dance on\nIn a frozen realm of lies",
        "[Bob Catley]\nBut the ice will break\nAnd you will scream repenting\nOh boy the ice will break\nYou'll just feel your heart rending",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRiding on to a world of funny flowers\nRiding on to the white wide world",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf coming back would hurt my pride\nI rather take another ride",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRiding on, winter on the mirror\nRiding on into the unknown",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf I'll awake in pain one day\nI gotta catch just one more train",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nDays gone by\nWho'd wanna live forever\nOn our knees up your road\nPaved with good intentions",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nFly high\nWhere angels can't breathe no more\nSome dare to go blind\nSome stay behind"
