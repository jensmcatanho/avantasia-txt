        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'm smothered but a lucid Nothing\nI can't hear and touch and see\nBut I feel it though I can't believe it",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBeen master of the observation\nComing up with an explanation\nThere was no need making use of the spirit",
        "[Temptation]\nOh, we can give you answers\nYou were dying to receive\nKeep on dreaming\nKeep on screaming",
        "[Temptation]\nYou might be getting too much\nFor your beating heart to take\nYour flesh is malice\nPrepare your chalice",
        "[Temptation]\nLight, breathe and sleep tight\nWill you defy intriguing ghost lights\nSeeing through all lies and foolish warnings\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nThere ain't no return",
        "[Magician]\nNever light the darkness\nIt may burn your soul away\nAs you'll be seeing\nWhat you thought you're dreaming",
        "[Temptation]\nNever open doors if you don't\nDare to walk on through\nIt may be your vault, now it's all your fault",
        "[Magician]\nLight, you're off to the light\nWill you defy all evil ghost lights\nTell the truth from decoration",
        "[Scientist I]\nTime, don't waste no time\nPrevail against the hands\nThat tick your flesh away\nNow delve into your own reflection",
        "[Scientist I]\nOh, you know that's where I've been too\nThere's nothing but a void out\nFor the sanity of fools",
        "[Temptation]\nShine your light into the darkness\nAnd let the storm descend upon you\nThen I will make you mine",
        "[Temptation]\nShine your light into the darkness\nBehold and let aurora fall upon your\nOh, let the storm descend upon you",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA journey to the other side\nOr just a tripping pleasure ride\nI don't know, but does it really matter?",
        "[Temptation]\nOh, I am he who has always been\nWho dares them though I can't be seen",
        "[Temptation]\nI'm illusion, or truth?\n I am confusion, yeah",
        "[Magician]\nLight, bring me that light\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nI will bring uncertainty on a silver plate\nLike a mantle piece\nI will wipe out darkness",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nNight, blessed is the night\nTill there's no time left to spill to save and kill\nTo take and seize\nYou just drift along",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAre they reflections of some crazy dream\nOr maybe the backside of reality",
        "[Magician]\nShine your light into the darkness\nAnd let the storm descend upon you\nThen I will make you mine",
        "[Magician]\nShine your light into the darkness\nBehold and let aurora fall upon your\nYeah, let the storm descend upon you",
        "[Scientist I]\nYou gotta pray your god ain't just a ghost light\nYou gotta pray you won't be falling down the wayside\nLet it carry you away",
        "[Scientist I]\nCut the gem until it's purified away\nThe candle burning to the ground\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nI don't see nothing but addiction to the ride\nThat kindles everything around",
        "[Magician]\nFor all the world will see it tower to the stars\nAnd all is melting into one\n\n[Scientist I]\nWe'll give them something to fall back on\nEverytime they're too strung-out to run",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nEvery moment, every heartbeat, every breath\nLeaves you one less to your last",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nEvery moment, every heartbeat, every breath\nLeaves you one less to your last\n\n[Scientist I]\nStill you cherish every second of the game\nGimme the future, you take the past",
        "[Magician]\nWhat if God is just an image in the mind\nA reflection of the will",
        "[Magician]\nWhat if God is just an image in the mind\nA reflection of the will\n\n[Scientist I]\nAnd what's the matter with a lie\nYou live in harmony with\nFor a sucker for the thrill",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI pray the Lord ain't just a ghost light in my mind\nA reflection of the will\nLet the storm descend upon me\nLet aurora fall upon me",
        "[Temptation]\nLet the fire fall upon him\nLet the fire purify him\nNever judge a thing you see\nIt's only what your mortal eyes will want it to be",
        "[Temptation]\nBring it on, let the dark inhale the confusion\nSpit out a conclusion",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAre they reflections or a memory\nOr just reflections in a crazy dream",
        "[Temptation]\nShine your light into the darkness\nAnd let the storm descend upon you\n\n[Magician]\nAnd I will make you mine",
        "[Temptation]\nShine your light into the darkness\n\n[Scientist I]\nBehold and let aurora fall upon you",
        "[Magician]\nShine your light into the darkness\n\n[Temptation]\nInto the darkness\n\n[Magician]\nAnd let the storm descend upon you\nThen I will make you mine",
        "[Scientist I]\nShine your light into the darkness\n\n[Temptation]\nInto the darkness\n\n[Magician]\nBehold and let aurora fall upon you\nOh, let the storm descend upon you"
