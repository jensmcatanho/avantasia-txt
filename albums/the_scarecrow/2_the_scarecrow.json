        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm just a loser in the game of love\nI'm just a stray boy in the shade",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd how I wish to know what love is like\nTo find someone to contemplate",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThere's a voice and a million answers\nTo the questions I don't ask\nA demon - I've got to contain",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen I'm walking through the fen\nGetting deep into the black\nThere are whispers that I can't restrain",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDon't give in",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRise to fame - time will come\nMake your claim - time has come\nFor the crow to fly away",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nSo you're an angel meant to walk down here\nAnd you believe it's all divine",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAnd you don't play by all those temporal rules\nYou watch the world begin to die",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAlright - when the lamb's been torn to pieces\nI've been crashing from the sky\nThe fallen to care for the prey",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThey put a spoke right in your wheel\nI'm the one to dare the weak\nTo push you all over the pain",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou give in",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI close my eyes\nAnd I see what's coming my way\nHe's got treasure in his eyes\nThat he's gonna turn to clay",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nI'm a stranger, I'm a changer\nAnd I'm danger... maybe...",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFallen angel - waiting for the prey\nThe devil has come to take a maimed away\nPenetration of the twisted mind\nThe evil is out for the weak and blind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI can feel it in your voice\nEver so sweet, no\nDo I really have a choice, no no no",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nOh, you burn your feet on unholy ground\nYou roam the barren wicked plains abound\nIn evil eyes and evil speaks\nAbound in all you evil freaks",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nWhen you say it's all divine\nAnd meant to be\nWhat about your flesh and blood\nAnd defiers like me?",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nTheir evil eyes are looking down on you\nAnd thos who don't are losing sight of you",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nFace the rage to chase away\nSpecter of disgrace and shame",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nWithered roses dying on the ledge\nA withered dreamer standing on the edge",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou dream of love but you wake up to pain\nYou're better off to join in my game",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThen she'll be better off to cry contrite tears\nOne day she'll wonder why\nShe had let you disappear oh dear",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYour time has come\nTo take the sun\nYou're drawn to the sound\nYou're leaving ground",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nThe flight of the crow\nCross the line\nFor the crow to fly away",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nIt's a flight to hell\nCan you hear the bell\nThe devil has come\nTo take your soul away",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nI'm a stranger\nI'm a changer\nAnd I'm danger\nFallen angel\nWaiting for the prey"
