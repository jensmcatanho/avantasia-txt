        "[Jon Oliva]\nLiving in the darkness\nWhat a cold and lonely night\nVoices in the darkness\nSing a sweet sweet lullaby",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nSomething's coming nearer\nAnyone to join in a game? A game\nWelcome to the attic\nHospitality is my name",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nEyes so alive\nI've been feeling pretty dead\nFor quite a while\nGimme a smile",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nDead-and-alive\nCome a little closer\nYou and I\nAffiliates forevermore and I'm alive\nDeath is just a feeling",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nYou and I swapping finitude\nAnd love for diamonds\nI'm just a little pale",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nDon't hesitate to sign right here\nDon't be afraid to come with me",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nSpecialized in temporizing\nDead to faulty love and time",
        "[Jon Oliva]\nFaulty time\nWe'll be dancing here\nForever and a while\nDay by day",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nValue by value\nI'm gonna turn into breath after breath",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLove we trade in for silver\nDefy what they use to call death",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd dust covered treasures will shine again\nAn unseen accolade\nLarger than life, a memory\nDeath will be just a charade"
