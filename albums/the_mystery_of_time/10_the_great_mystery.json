        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nHow could I let it get this far?\nTo the edge I've been drawn by promises",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd what's the reason\nFor a heart to only misguide me\nBlind me, tear myself apart?",
        "[Epiphany]\nWhen darkness falls and silence talks\nAt the edge of thoughts that you memorised",
        "[Epiphany]\nI'm the truth between the lines\nThey read and deny me and tie me to fantasy",
        "[Epiphany]\nAnd they'll curse this darkest hour\nWhen in oblivion I'll die",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOh, will you make me turn the page, one after another\nIf only you would make a mark the eye can see",
        "[Epiphany]\nYou're dancing in a round\nThrough the dark you long to find\nA light in a midnight sky\nTo persuade the night",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nDon't leave me blind, give me one sign\nGrant me just one look into the mystery behind",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nFire and flames, heartache and pain:\nYou break me just to make me feel like a golden child",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWhat if it's nothing but a dream\nThe great mystery",
        "[Science]\nWe carry the flame to accelerate\nThe evolution of an age\nCast your eyes into the crystal ball",
        "[Science]\nWe embrittle the weak that isn't meant to be\nWe're gonna make it coronate the chosen ones\nWho never sinned against their vocation",
        "[Reason]\nDon't be afraid: just look around\nDon't question what your eyes can see",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nFire and flames, heartache and pain:\nI've borne for my devotion",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOh, she won't see me, she won't feel me\nShe's lost on her won, and so am I?",
        "[Epiphany]\nI see a cold moon rise above thos empty streets\nAnd I see movements part their lives",
        "[Epiphany]\nI hear the ticking leaving scars you can't conceal\nAin't it poignant how you try",
        "[Epiphany]\nImpatiently they're giving up on hearts\nWhose signs they cannot read\nAs silence doesn't talk, eternity will cease",
        "[Epiphany]\nAnd as you marvel at the artwork in your hands\nRich in detail, so frail and beautiful",
        "[Epiphany]\nAnd you forget the rules\nThe elder's always made up for you\nTo save you precious time",
        "[Epiphany]\nYou watch them pile up, they're saving on and on\nEven you don't know where they store it all\nYou've got to be a fool if you don't save along",
        "[Epiphany]\nA thousand screaming\nAnd silence doesn't speak to thousands screaming\nNo, silence doesn't wanna speak",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAnd I see tears shed over days when all was good\nA child didn't care for what never really mattered",
        "[Epiphany]\nI see tears shed over days\nWhen all was good and time\nThey had a lot to give away",
        "[Epiphany]\nWhen their hears had eyes to see\nAnd the final mystery\nWas more than a fancy tale",
        "[Epiphany]\nAnd answers you did find\nTo dare what you would find inside",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOh, is it really not a dream?\nThe great mystery"
