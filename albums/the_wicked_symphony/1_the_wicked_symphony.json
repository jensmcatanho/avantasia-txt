        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou'll be running out of miracles\nLike I'm running out of dreams\nMadness lurking to my left\nAngels faint in front of me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd I see eyes to the right\nI hear a promise resound\nGold and diamonds, love and fame\nAnd music meant to remain",
        "[Russel Allen]\nYou've been dying for glory\nYou've been looking for love\nWhy don't we read the signs\nWhen we're about to get lost",
        "[JÃ¸rn Lande]\nA seeker enthralled by a flame\nEventually home to his pain\nThe Great Unbeloved\nYou reach for the final stage"
