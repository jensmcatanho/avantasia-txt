        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWhere do I go?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNever had a very real dream before\nNow I got a vision of an open door\nGuiding me home, where I belong\nDreamland I have come",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNever had a flesh and blood like this before\nGot a new appearance when I passed the door\nIs it a dream I am within? Oh, what's going on?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDown, go down, down, go down, down, go down",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI roam into nowhere\nDon't see and end: eternal wastelands\nAnd I hear the voice, the voice, the voice, the voice",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nHallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNever been a fighter, never been a man\nBut I must help Vandroiy, he's my only friend\nNowhere to go but I know that he knows how\nWe will get her out",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nMagic of transcendence\nBrought me to this place\nVandroiy in reality lead me on my race\nTold me to bring back the seal\nBut still I don't know where I shall go",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nCan't you feel the voice?\nYou don't have a choice\nWhat a kind of live:\nFreedom in flesh - shackles on your mind",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nGo all the way to the tower\nFind out the secret behind\nGo all the way to the tower\nFor all the wisdom of ages doesn't die",
        "[Elderane]\nMen have good intentions\nOn their way to the light\nBut some of them are venal\nAnd end up in the night",
        "[Elderane]\nMaybe it's better for you, mankind\nNot to know what's going on",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSometimes we must go\nWays that seem to be wrong",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWhat a kind of life: Freedom in flesh\nShackles on your mind",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nGo all the way to the tower\nFind out the secrets behind\nGo all the way to the tower\nFind out the name of the one\nWho reigns from inside",
        "[Voice in the Tower]\nYou have come the long way through ages\nTo bring me the seven parts of the seal\nSo now throw it over the walls of the tower\nThrow the seal!",
        "[Pope Clemens VIII]\nBut first Godfather, what about the prophecy?\nWhat about your reward: The ultimate illumination\nThe gnosis and the power to defend your kingdom on earth with a strong hand?\nWhat about the prophecy?",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nI realize",
        "[All]\nFor the glory, for the glory, for the glory\nFor the glory. Oh - what's going on?",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nGabriel I can feel:\nYou have it back - book and seal\nStill no war is won, we have just began",
        "[Lugaid Vandroiy]\nGo all the way to the tower\nFind out the secrets behind\nGo all the way to the tower\nFound out the name of the one\nOf the one",
        "[Jakob]\nOh, how could the stranger steal the seal away?\nWas it my fault? Or was it no one's fault at all?\nAt all..."
