        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nComing from the wastelands\nFull of reason, common sense\nWhere their principles are blocking minds\nAnd you don't understand",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nGiving you belief\nYou never touch, you never ee\nBut if you dare to try to grip it\nYou're accused for heresy",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nHere I stand to find the truth\nAnd for ought I know\nYou're the one to show me\nYou can tell my spirit how to grow",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nNo, the more I try\nThe more confusion on my mind\nAnd no matter how I try\nI feel my eyes seem to stay blind",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nNo use in analysing, forget about alchemy\nBecause the secret of all truth\nIs the quest for - and you'll feel",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nWhen you know right on the door\n\"Forever locked\" they say\nA little man will let you in\nFor you have always tried to get inside",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nYou're in quest for more to find the core\nYour journey still ain't over\nYour quest is your purpose, go on",
        "[Tree of Knowledge]\nYou're in quest for more to find the core\nIt will be never over\nYour quest is your purpose, go on"
