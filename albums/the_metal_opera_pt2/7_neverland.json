        "[Bishop Johann von Bicken]\nCaught in neverland, no purpose to be seen\nThere's no point of destination",
        "[Bishop Johann von Bicken]\nNeverending wastelands, such a wicked odyssey\nDon't know what we have done wrong",
        "[Bishop Johann von Bicken]\nLead us back to Rome to follow you again\nBring you power, get salvation",
        "[Bishop Johann von Bicken]\nI know less than all but more than many who know less\n I know it's keeping us strong",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd while they are pulling strings\nWhile they are in command\nThe're hanging on strings\nAnd fate they do commend into another hand",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nCaught in neverland, heat and fire, snow and ice\nThe call nether world what we call a paradise",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nCaught in neverland and their spirits cannot rise\nFrom the nether world, they can't see a paradise",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nAnd the Roman whore, the masters and the slaves\nRaging on without they don't know",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nGood intentions on their minds\nCan't ask for why they bow down",
        "[Bishop Johann von Bicken]\nLead us to Eden, judge those who bite off more\nThan they can chew to serve, without they ask\nOr call in doubt the task",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nCaught in neverland in the place of many eyes\nMake it be what they are allowed to realize"
