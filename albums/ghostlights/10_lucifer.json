        "[Temptation]\nEternities ago I must have fallen\nThrough my pride\nBeen perfect in my ways",
        "[Temptation]\nThe morning star they fired down from heaven\nEnvy wrapped into a gown of grace",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI hear the screams that echo from the darkness\nI swerve from dawn to dusk and off the edge\n\n[Temptation]\nHear the creature crying in the distance\nBuried in a symbol on a shelf",
        "[Temptation]\nI'll take your home tonight\nTo the center of your soul\nI'll take your home tonight\nFire and flesh and blood",
        "[Aaron & Temptation]\nTouching the flames tonight\nTouching the flames tonight\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nMorning star embrace me on these grounds\nAngel of light",
        "[Temptation]\nHow will I forgive Him who wouldn't forgive\nForgive me who just valued the power",
        "[Temptation]\nHow shall I live in peace with the one\nOutshining me and then have me devoured",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI'm feeling alive under these skies\nBloodshot's the moon and scarlet's the night\n\n[Temptation]\nI'll make you fume with fury and rage\nI'll make you see\nWhat you're made of tonight",
        "[Aaron & Temptation]\nTouching the flames tonight\nTouching the flames tonight\n\n[Temptation]\nTouching the flames tonight"
