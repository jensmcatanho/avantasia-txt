        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou see the sun touch the horizon\nYou know the future awaits\nAnd yours hides in the darkness",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThe stars are gonna line up in the night sky\nI see what some will deny\nAs I follow the starkness",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nCan you believe your eyes\nWe'll make you rise to the occasion\nFollow your heart and run\nSeek shelter from the day",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nWaiting for the moon\nThe sound of falling angels calling you\nStrange and magic\nHear us all your name",
        "[Robert Mason]\nDarkness shines a sweet\nDeceleration down on you\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nWayward child wake up to the moon",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nThey wanna squeeze you in their picture\nFrom the outside\nThey call your life a world of make-believe",
        "[Michael Kiske]\nYou're feeling pushed by a racing heartbeat\nParameterizing the world\nThey only see what they're told to see",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nChild of the ocean floor\nNo need of daylight that deceives you\nDon't let them wear you down\nListen to the voice",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWaiting for the moon\nThe sound of falling angels calling you\n\n[Jorn Lande]\nStrange and magic\nHear us call your name",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nDarkness shines a sweet deceleration down on you\nWayward child wake up to the moon",
        "[Bob Catley]\nKind of buried alive\nYou've been sacrificed\nThey show you the key\nTill you love to agree\nA brave modern day\nThis world is insane"
