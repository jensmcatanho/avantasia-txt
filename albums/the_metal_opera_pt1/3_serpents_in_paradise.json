        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nReading the madness they took her away\nUnder the cross\nBailiff and bishop and monk\nMalleus Maleficarum - the law",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nPrayed for salvation, I fought for her soul\nScared by the horned\nThe devil was creeping around\nUntil she died in the flames as he saw",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nFather forgive me for I've hardly seen\nThe human deep within.\nJust an intention so holy and clear",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nPaving the way to madness for us\nSerpents on the way to paradise\nDying for love, fighting for ages\nSerpents on the way to paradise\nRaging with anger and pain for the cross",
        "[Jakob]\nFather forgive me for what I have done\nFor I betrayed the one that I loved like a son",
        "[Jakob]\nDemons and spells are they reality?",
        "[Jakob]\nThe pest and schism; the power of the Moor\nWe've got to fight. Keep our people afraid...",
        "[Jakob]\nKeep them away from what they shall not see",
        "[Jakob]\nI see a menace to our paradise\nIn these evil times\nHeaven is burning, people are yearning\nFor a new doctrine",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSerpents on the way to paradise\n\n[Jakob]\nDon't know they'll end in final damnation",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSerpents on the way to paradise\n\n[Jakob]\nRaging with anger and pain against the cross",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nLord if I'm an unbeliever - what do I believe? Can you tell me lord what you had done\nIf you were me?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI have stared into the eyes\nOf innocence and fear\nI saw Anna in the tower in a lake of tears",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nSomething strange is going on and\nStill I don't know why\nI have stared into the secrets\nThey still try to hide",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nVandroiy can you tell me\nWhat you know about it all?\nVandroiy can you help me\nTo leave this prison hall?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nVandroiy can you help me\nFree Anna from the chain?\nVandroiy can you help me\nTo become a little sane?"
