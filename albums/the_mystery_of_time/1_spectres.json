        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThrough the shimmer on this cold alley paving\nSee the moonshine painting the ground\nCobble stones keeping tales that remain untold\nMore than ages old",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBrewing mist like a shroud on the damp floor\nHear it whisper lucidity away",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOrnate cold is the king of these streets tonight\nThe void is taking hold",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nMake haste as the wind's getting colder\nIt's chasing the dreamer away",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWide open minds will divine without reason\nCold is the night as you're braving the gale",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWide open eyes\nA spectre is breezing through a moonlit sky",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nSee them guises on the prowl, what a show!\nFeel them shadows drag you into a nightmare\nTo the melody of which you don't know\nIf it's really there",
        "[Science & Zeitgeist]\nDance in the gloom, dance in the gloom\nEvery move is a step to your tomb",
        "[Science & Zeitgeist]\nWe're the machine that's gonna make you dream\nPhantasmagoria",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nTime flies from the space of an hour\nTelling tales in the poorhouse they say",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWide open eyes and a spectre is breezing\nCold is the night as you're braving the gale",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nWide open minds - once upon a moonlit night"
