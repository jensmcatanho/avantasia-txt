        "[Antiquarian]\nYou're caught in the land of no sun\nWithout reason or rhyme\nYou're avid for splendour",
        "[Antiquarian]\nThe spin of the hand is your pace on the run\nWe got no time to turn\nWhen we strive after grandeur",
        "[Antiquarian]\nHere you got your hero slicing up your ecstacy\nOn the verge of lunacy",
        "[Antiquarian]\nThere's no time to lose\nNo chance to refuse",
        "[Antiquarian]\nWill you deny what you see\n(As you) tear down the nature of reason\nThat has shown you the way\nWhere clock hands freeze",
        "[Aaron Blackman]\nI know what I see\nAnd I know what I don't\nThrough your dark swamp\nI walk on deductive conclusion",
        "[Aaron Blackman]\nA little more time?\nI admit I would take\nBut then again\nIt would mean more time for confusion",
        "[Aaron Blackman]\nYou think you got your prodigy\nEverytime your eyes don't see\nVictim of perplexity",
        "[Aaron Blackman]\nThere's no time to lose\nNo need to refuse"
