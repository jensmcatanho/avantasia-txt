    "lyrics": [
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAll of a tremble\nYou can feel their poison arrows\nHave left their mark",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nHigher and higher\nWanna seize the day\nWhile you're waiting for the dark",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou're running from the disdain\nYou know this time\nYou won't turn around",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nChasing an illusion, disillusion\nDesire leading, downward bound",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nInto the black\nYou are tracing the riddle\nWhere no man's been",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNo turning back\nNo more lost in the middle\nNever again, never again",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nOnce you have opened your eyes\nDown in the dark you'll be crossing the line",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm a believer on the receiving end\nOf the bat they hold with grace",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nDead to the voices of the anxious\nTimid of him who must not be named",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nEnticing me away now as the sun sets\nTo the truth that lies beyond",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm chasing an illusion, an illusion\nRevelation I'm coming home",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nInto the black\nYou are tracing the riddle\nWhere no man's been",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nNo turning back\nNo more lost in the middle\nNever again, never again",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nOnce you have opened your eyes\nDown in the dark you'll be crossing the line",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou turn your back on the one\nWilling to make up his mind",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nNo you never stood in my shoes\nEvil versus divine",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nYou're feeling drawn to purity\nLike a moth to the flame",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nLight at the end of the tunnel\nStrange how the voice of the savior\nRoars like a train"
