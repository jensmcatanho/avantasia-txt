        "[Jorn Lande]\nI am the master of the game that's made a fool of you\nI'm watching from the highest tower",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou got the aura to enchant and a symphony\nAnd I have got the power",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nYou better taste: they call it life - my special area\nI'm breeding winners over there",
        "[Jorn Lande]\nAin't it a sin to turn your back on what you're given\nIt's time to take your share",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nGod left me for dead - I've been turning my head\nAway from the living - the time has come\nTo gamble for gain - To tear down the gate\nand see what's inside",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe rock the ball\nBeen smashed to the ground\nArose from devotion\nTo take a look and see what is inside\nSight of the crown\nAnother angel down",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe rock the ball\nI'm facing my pain\nWith a rage and a symphony\nDriven by the wounds I cannot hide\nRise above the crowd\nAnother angel down",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe'll see a black hole will be left up in the starry sky\nWe gotta mourn another angel",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf I am just a light descending into caducity\nIt's still so far away",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThere's no tomorrow\nI don't remember yesterday\nI'm just living for tonight",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd all the love I'm not gonna waste no more\nI won't spill what's divine",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nThey let you for dead - turning your head\nAway from the living - from flesh and blood\nYou've got the draw and desire to claw\nFor fortune and fame"
