        "[Scientist II]\nIt ain't the far cry that it seemed\nIn just a wink we'd come for your\nYou may not feel it",
        "[Scientist II]\nWe are the light, the scorching heat\nWe are the untold chosen few\nAnd now we've come for you",
        "[Scientist II]\nWe'll fit you like a velvet glove\nThat's gonna choke their minds",
        "[Scientist II]\nAffiliate yourself with that you can't defy",
        "[Scientist II]\nSome below and few above\nWe're gonna numb their minds",
        "[Scientist II]\nRiot on the edge\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nOn the brink of insanity\n\n[Scientist II]\nRiot on the edge",
        "[Scientist II]\nYou'll hear me screaming your name\nI am the angel of decay to seize you",
        "[Scientist II]\nThere'll be no thoughts to maintain\nI'm the seduction of decay",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI hear their tales reverberate\nFrom shrouds of myth that only time would weave",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nBred in a den of lunacy\nWho can we trust? Who's next in line?\nThe sacred drive to rationalize",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nCommit ourselves another day\nTo the lesser crime\n\n[Scientist II]\nChoke on your own pace with candour",
        "[Scientist II]\nChoke on your own pace with candour\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nSo pleasant in the quiet\nVicegerents of the tide",
        "[Scientist II]\nTime contaminating space\nTo reinfect and agonize anything around",
        "[Scientist II]\nWe are metabolite of dreams\nThe chosen ones to sacrifice\nThe wasteland-bound",
        "[Scientist II]\nOh, Euphoria is looming in the darkness\nCoincedence of opposites we are\nOnce beautiful intentions",
        "[Scientist II]\nOh, we'll drag you over\nOh, it's gonna drag you over",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nOh, from the start we run away\nAnd don't seem to care what for",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nForever feels just like a blink after passing by\nJust fools don't know the prime's another state of decay"
