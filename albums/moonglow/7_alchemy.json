        "[Geoff Tate]\nThe writing's on the wall\nWill you go on and fool yourself?\nIn no time you'll be done",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nRefusing to adjust yourself to the flow\nWhy walk the stoney road?\nYou won't get out alive",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nNobody understands it, do you?\nCome in and look around:\nEvery single stroke, they say\nWas worth the pain",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nNow, in this gallery of wonder\nYou wonder what it's all about\nWell, selling sun in the rain",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe're gonna give them bite-sized harmony\nOh, we're gonna shove it down their throats",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nDreams and fire - we are alchemy\nWe set out on the losing end\nGonna make you whole again",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nWaste to diamonds - we are alchemy\nNo one to be left in need\nWe're gilding their reality",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWe gotta keep 'em dancing\nWhile tears pour out of blackened skies\nAnother shade of drama",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nSpectators weeping over cries\nThat broken heroes\nDrag from crazy minds",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd by the way now:\n\nThey who pay the piper call the tune at last\nKnowing what you wanna give and what is gonna do",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeeding on disre\nThe spectres shall arise\nRight in front of their eyes",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nWe're gonna give them perfect harmony\nOh, we're gonna shove it down their throats",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nWe'd never lie\nWe're never ever gonna let you down\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nWhen danger and distraction lie in wait",
        "[Geoff Tate]\nWe'd never lie\nWhen dreams aspire to take you down\nWe'd never dare to lie to you\nYou're just spared the part of truth that doesn't make any sense to you",
        "[Tobias Sammet & Geoff Tate]\nNo one's to be left in need\nA new take on reality"
