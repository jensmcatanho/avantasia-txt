        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIll-defined as I look in the mirror\nAm I blind, am I blind?",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAm I given or just a straying fool\nFeel it near\nSomething's here to watch",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI feel their eyes sending shivers down my spine\nEvil eyes, evil eyes",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nSee me crawling as I'm falling off the edge\nParalyze, tantalize",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nFeel it here\nFrom everywhere it sounds",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nAnd you'll fall away from heaven\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nOnce you know you can't take no more of it",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nYou will fall away from heaven\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nBy the time you can see the crime against you",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nHey - desperation\nAngels crashing from the sky",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nHow can you hold on to your way\nIn your mental disarray",
        "[Jørn Lande]\nI am your struggles\nThe answer to your pain\nI am the fury in your eyes\nI am reason, I am vice",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIt's there\nFrom everywhere it sounds"
