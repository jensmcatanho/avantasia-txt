        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWalking down a lonely road\nA ghost city sidewalk scene\nAnd I wonder if there's a place\nWhere they bury all their unborn dreams",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nSome castle in the sky, a plce that only I can back down to\nAnd look out for that shining guide ablaze, out somewhere",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWaiting for a sign in vain\nThat's gonne shine away the pain\nGonna draw the moonlight down\nAll is gonna tumble down",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAre you gonna guide me starlight\nGuide me starlight\nWon't you send me a sign?",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou're adrift until you strand\nDesert island of mundanity",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nYou circle around in solutide\nWithin the walls they call austerity",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nI know maybe it's insane\nTo dream of what you'll never gain\nNothing on the line\nDriven by unsettled certainty",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nWaiting for a sign in vain\nThat's gonna shine away the pain\nGonna cite a figment down\nYet I'm gonna stick around",
        "[Ronnie Atkins]\nAre you gonna guide me starlight\nGuide me starlight\nAre you there, anywhere at all?\n\n[Tobias Sammet]\nAnywhere at all",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nIf only I'd burn out before I'd hit the ground\nJust like you before they're near me",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nRun out in the clouds forever near me\nI won't even be a foolish memory",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nWaiting for a sign in vain\nOrphan star, shine on me"
