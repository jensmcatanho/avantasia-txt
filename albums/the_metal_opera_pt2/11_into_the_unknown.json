        "[Anna Held]\nHeading for another life\nIn a new world far away",
        "[Anna Held]\nWhy not me, oh Lord\nWhy did Vandroiy had to die, why?",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nDreamers come and go\nBut a dream's forever\nFreedom for all minds\nLet us go together\nNeverending ways\nGot to roam forever\nAlways carry on",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nWalking down a misty road into the unknown\nHeavy winds may blow into our faces",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nYou can't kill the dream in killing the dreamer\nCan't tear it down\nAlways carry on",
        "[Gabriel Laymann]\nI've seen dreamers come and go"
