        "[Mystic]\nYou're tossing and turning\nYou think you're awake while you're trying to run\nLike in a nightmare\nTime loves your ego to death",
        "[Mystic]\nYou're leaving the wheelwork\nTo the ground of being you go on\nDefying temptation in the engine room\nThat is our Self",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nI feel a storm is looming with a shaking grumble\nI don't know if I'm right or wrong\nI don't know if I shall go on\nI don't know what I'll believe but I'm on my way",
        "[Mystic]\nMinds fly free when the gates fly open\nWalk on through\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nThunder and rain and the wind in my face",
        "[Mystic]\nGhost lights dance\nWill you heed the token\nGlazing light\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nBlinding my eyes\nGet me out of this maze",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe world as we know it is beginning to shake\nI don't trust mye yes, are we all superstitious\nIf we whink what our hearts know is true",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nFireworks sorround me\nWherever I go they tell me: always home\nPsychosomatic - they'll name it the nature of God",
        "[Mystic]\nOff to a new horizon\nTime is the key to unite with the All\nTime is gonna make you see\nRight from wrong eternally",
        "[Mystic]\nDon't let the noises devour your",
        "[Temptation]\nAnd what if you're only a prism\nFor the ghost lights yhat you wanna see\nAnd we're just reflections of your dreams",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nIt's speaking to me\nIt's yelling at me\nIt's screaming to me, resonation with me\nAnd a thousand light are trying to make me see",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThey call me home, they call me home"
