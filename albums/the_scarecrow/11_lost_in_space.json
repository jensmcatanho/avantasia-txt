        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnother star has fallen without sound\nAnother spark has burned out in the cold",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnother door to the barren standing open\nAnd who is there to tell me not to give in, not to go",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHow could I know - how could I know\nThat'll get lost in space to roam forever",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nHow could I know - how could I see\nFeeling like lost in space to roam forever",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nI'm crawling down the doorway to the badlands\nBeen kicking down all yer hurdles to the black",
        "[Tobias Sammet]\nAnd all the damage fading in the rearview mirror\nAnd the demons are calling me\nThe're dragging me away",
        "[Amanda Somerville]\nLost in space - Lost in time\nLost in space - Lost in time"
