        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA lot of good advice\nNobody's keeping for themselves\nIf you're playing by the rules\nYou'll be a trophy on a shelf",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nGive in to the ordinary run of things\nLike it is meant to be\nThere's nothing left of me",
        "[Scientist I]\nPraying for salvation, floating with the tide\nThe very first temptation\nDrags you to the other side",
        "[Scientist I]\nYou learn to walk and run\nYou fly until you fall as far as I can see",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe future ahead was not what it used to be\n\n[Scientist I]\nBlessed was the darkness - veiling hypocrisy",
        "[Scientist I]\nBabylon is burning, shining from afar\nBabylon is burning\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nFrom sunset to sunrise",
        "[Scientist I]\nBabylon is burning\nAnd you're glowing like a fiery star\nAnd no one can tell if we've been for real",
        "[Scientist I]\nBabylon is burning\nBabylon is burning",
        "[Scientist I]\nThey say it's coming by the night\nTo engraft into the brain\nWhat a scientific tongue won't recall or even phrase",
        "[Scientist I]\nIt's crawling up your spine\nTo breed a wicked freak of nature\nWe will be a new society",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nA headless congregation, a vortex needing more\n\n[Scientist I]\nThe road to good intentions is evil to the core\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe devil and the deep blue sea are waiting\nSide by side for me",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe devil and the deep blue sea are waiting\nSide by side for me",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nThe sweet scent of poison\nHazing the dread away\nThis side of the moon I'll confess to\nAnother day",
        "[Scientist I]\nBabylon is burning, shining from afar\n\n[Aaron Blackwell]\nBabylon is burning\nFrom sunset to sunrise",
        "[Scientist I]\nEver since I can remember\nI've been shooting up that road with a dream",
        "[Scientist I]\nI saw gold at the end of the rainbow\nI was given and idea of what life should be\nWhat like should be",
        "[Aaron Blackwell]\nAin't there a light above the shadow\nAin't there blood in the machine\nAin't there flesh they'd been misleading\nAin't there a longing soul within?",
        "[Scientist I]\nI've seen believers on the wayside\nAnd I'm afraid to say, I think just like you\nThat failed to pretend",
        "[Scientist I]\nThey could cope with what they'd find\nWhen they didn't have a clue - just like you"
